|on |
|the subject of|
|the concept of|
|the idea of|
|the theme of|
|to |
|It's a great day to fall in love all over again.|
|People do get so carried away sometimes, but not I.|
|Sometimes I just don't like somebody.|
|How can someone be so consumed by hate?|
|I get so jealous sometimes.|
|I don't understand how somebody can become so obsessed by what somebody else has.|
|Be happy!|
|Is there something to be happy about?|
|It really gets me down sometimes.|
|How can people be so glum?|
|I have trouble controlling my temper.|
|People can be so angry, and I just don't understand it.|
|W... worried?  Do I look worried?|
|There's nothing to be upset about.|
|I'm feeling randy today!|
|I just don't understand these flames of passion people go on about.|
|I don't handle pressure well.|
|I'm at my best under pressure.|
|Yes, I want more.  Is that so bad?|
|Why are they so fixated on these baubles?|
|I could really use a drink.|
|So I overindulge sometimes.|
|Sometimes I think I need a drink, but I can control myself.|
|I am not governed by urges.|
|There's nothing like a good brawl.|
|Why must they be so violent?|
|Get me going and I won't stop for anything.|
|Maybe I give up too early sometimes.|
|I don't always do things in the most efficient way.|
|We must be careful not to waste.|
|I don't mind stirring things up.|
|It's so great when everybody just gets along.|
|You're so perceptive!|
|You don't care, so don't ask.|
|I try to live and behave properly.|
|What's this about proper living?|
|I was never one to follow advice.|
|I'm not much of a decision maker.|
|Have no fear.|
|Bravery is not a strength of mine.|
|We will be successful.|
|I don't think I'm cut out for this.|
|I look splendid today.|
|Some people are so wrapped up in themselves.|
|My goals are important to me.|
|I don't feel like I need to chase anything.|
|One should always return a favor.|
|It's not a gift if you expect something in return.|
|I like to dress well.|
|I wouldn't feel comfortable getting all dressed up.|
|Did you hear the one about the |
| and the |
|That isn't funny.|
|Don't get on my bad side.|
|You shouldn't waste your life on revenge.|
|I am a very, very important person.|
|Oh, I'm nothing special.|
|There's no room for mercy in this world.|
|Show some mercy now and again.|
|I'm concentrating on something.|
|Huh?  What was that?|
|I'm feeling optimistic about the future.|
|It won't turn out well.|
|I'm curious.  Tell me everything!|
|I don't really want to know.|
|I wonder what they think.|
|Who cares what they think?|
|I could tell you all about it!|
|I don't feel like telling you about it.|
|If you have a task, do it properly.|
|It's not perfect, but it's good enough.  Why fret about it?|
|I'm not going to change my mind.|
|Try to keep an open mind.|
|Everybody has their own way of life.|
|I don't understand why they have to be that way.|
|Friendship is forever.|
|I don't really get attached to people.|
|I go with the flow sometimes.|
|Don't bother trying to play on my emotions.|
|I'm happy to help.|
|Why should I help?|
|Do your duty.|
|I don't like being obligated to anybody.|
|Oh, I don't usually think much.|
|One must always carefully consider the correct course of action.|
|Everything just so in its proper place!|
|It's my mess.|
|People are basically trustworthy.|
|My trust is earned, and not by many.|
|It's such a joy to be with people.|
|I prefer to be by myself.|
|People should listen to what I have to say.|
|I try not to interrupt.|
|There's so much to be done!|
|What's the rush?|
|I need some more excitement in my life.|
|I'd just as soon not have anything too exciting happen today.|
|Do you have dreams?  Tell me a story!|
|Try to focus on the practical side of the matter.|
|I encountered a fascinating conundrum recently.|
|A great piece of art is one that moves me.|
|I guess I just don't appreciate art.|
|Be mindful of the law.|
|What gives them the right to establish these laws?|
|Never forget true loyalty.|
|Don't serve anyone blindly.  You'll only get into trouble.|
|How great it is to be surrounded by family!|
|I was always irritated by family.|
|There's nothing like a good friend.|
|Be careful of your so-called friends.|
|Strive for power.|
|There's nothing admirable about bullying others.|
|Always tell the truth.|
|There are times when it is alright not to tell the whole truth.|
|I do admire a clever trap.|
|There's no value in all of this scheming I see these days.|
|I do admire a clever turn of phrase.|
|Who are these mealy-mouthed cowards trying to impress?|
|Always deal fairly.|
|Don't be afraid to do anything to get ahead in this world.|
|Please maintain your dignity.|
|What do you care how I speak or how I live?|
|Some things should never change.|
|We need to find a better way.|
|Art is life.|
|What's so special about art?|
|We should all work together.|
|It's better to work alone when possible, I think.  Cooperation breeds weakness.|
|I treasure my freedom.|
|Nobody is truly free.|
|I feel nothing.|
|Do not hide yourself behind an unfeeling mask.|
|It is important to discover yourself.|
|Why would I waste time thinking about myself?|
|I think self-control is important.|
|Why deny yourself your heart's desire?|
|Oh tranquil days!|
|Give me the bustle and noise over all that quiet!|
|We should all be as one.  Why all the struggling?|
|We grow through debate and struggle, even chaos and discord.|
|Be merry!|
|Bah!  I hope you aren't celebrating something.|
|An artisan, their materials and the tools to shape them!|
|Masterwork?  Why should I care?|
|A skilled warrior is a beautiful sight to behold.|
|Why this obsession with weapons and battle?  I don't understand some people.|
|We should all be so lucky as to truly master a skill.|
|Broaden your horizons.  There's more to life than becoming great at just one thing.|
|Work hard.|
|Work hard?  How foolish.|
|We must be ready to sacrifice when the time comes.|
|Why harm yourself for others?|
|It's a competitive world, and you'd be a fool to think otherwise.|
|All of this striving against one another is so foolish.|
|Keep going and never quit.|
|Anybody that sticks to something a moment longer than they have to is an idiot.|
|Wouldn't it be grand to just take my life off and do nothing for the rest of my days?|
|There's work to be done!|
|Let's make a deal.|
|All of this buying and selling isn't honest work.|
|How romantic I feel!|
|These people carrying on about romance should be more practical.|
|How I love to be out exploring the wilds!|
|I could do without all of those creatures and tangled greenery.|
|Let there be peace throughout the world.|
|How I long for the beautiful spectacle of war!|
|I cannot stand the world any longer...|
|Everything is all piling up at once!|
|I'm feel like I'm about to snap.|
|I just don't care anymore...|
|I feel so tired of everything.|
|I can't take much more of this!|
|I feel angry all the time.|
|I'm feeling really worn down.|
|It's all starting to get me down.|
|I've been feeling anxious.|
|I get fed up sometimes.|
|I've been under some pressure.|

|I could not care less.|

|Astonishing!|
|I really need to get away from this.|
|I'm awe-struck!|
|I'm terribly bitter about this...|
|This is so boring!|
|I care so much!|
|I'm so incredibly confused...|
|I can't describe the contempt I feel...|
|I am so content about this.|
|I feel so dejected...|
|How very delightful!|
|I despair at this!|
|My disappointment is palpable!|
|How disgusting!|
|How naive I was...  this strikes me to the core.|
|I feel such an intense dislike...|

|Not that it's your business!  Harumph!|
|The guilt is almost unbearable!|
|Such happiness!|
|I am consumed by hatred.|
|I am filled with such hope!|
|There is no hope!|
|The humiliation!|
|Such an offense!|
|How incredibly interesting!|
|How irritating!|
|I feel so isolated!|
|Such a jolly time!|
|How jovial I feel!|

|I'm sympathetic.|
|I feel tenderness.|
|Thrilling.|
|I'm uneasy.|
|I'm unhappy.|
|It's wondrous.|
|It's worrisome.|
|The wrath rises within me...|
|I am ready for this.|
|Takes all kinds these days.|
|What is it this time...|
|That did not shock me.|
|I am not upset by this.|
|Grief?  I feel nothing.|
|There is no need for celebration.|
|I have no feelings of rage.|
|I guess it could be considered grimly satisfying.|
|This does not scare me.|
|I am not feeling sad right now.|
|That was not satisfying.|
|I suppose this would be a joyous occasion.|
|There is no love.|
|I do not see the bliss in this.|
|There is no need to feel vengeful.|
|I laugh in the face of death!|
|I do not accept this.|

|That was not amusing.|
|I'm not angry.|
|This is nothing.|
|No, that's not annoying.|
|I'm not anxious.|
|If I thought about it more, I guess I'd be apathetic.|
|That is not in the least bit arousing.|
|Astonished?  No.|
|I'm not averse to it.|
|I am not held in awe.|
|That's nothing to be bitter about.|
|It isn't boring.|
|I don't care.|
|This isn't confusing.|
|I don't feel contempt.|
|I am not contented.|
|There's nothing to be dejected about.|
|I am not filled with delight.|
|I will not despair.|
|I'm not disappointed.|
|It'll take more than that to disgust me.|
|This won't make me lose faith.|
|I don't dislike that.|
|I'm not dismayed.|
|I feel no displeasure.|
|This isn't distressing.|
|I am not eager.|
|I'm not elated.|
|This isn't embarrassing.|

|I'm not enjoying this.|
|This isn't exasperating.|
|I am not exhilarated.|
|I should be feeling ferocious right now.|

|No, I'm not interested.|
|This isn't irritating.|
|I don't feel isolated.|
|I'm not jolly.|
|This doesn't put me in a jovial mood.|
|This isn't the time for jubilation.|
|I am not filled with loathing.|

|I am not burning with lust.|
|I'm not miserable.|

|I have no shame.|
|There will be no sympathy from me.|
|I don't feel tenderness.|
|There was no thrill in it.|
|I'm not uneasy.|
|That doesn't make me unhappy.|
|There is no sense of wonder.|
|I'm not worried.|
|Wrath has not risen within me.|
|I have no zeal for this.|
|I am a parent.|
|Children.|
|I have fallen for |

|It feeds on blood.|
|It is drinking the blood of the living.|
|The battle rages...|
|This is a fight!|
|In the midst of conflict...|
|Has the tide turned?|
|How fragile we are...|
|How fleeting life is...|
|Gruesome wounds!|
|So easily broken...|
|Those injuries...|
|Can it all end so quickly?|

|Hello|
|Hey|
|An honor as always.  How can I be of service?|
|.  It is good to see you.|
| is dumbstruck for a moment.|
|A legend?  Here?  I can scarcely believe it.  |
|I am honored to be in your presence.  |
|It is an honor.  |
|Your name precedes you.  Thank you for all that you have done.  |
|It is good to finally meet you!  |
|Welcome home, my child.|
|Welcome to the |
|How are you, my |
|It's great to have a friend like you!|
|And what exactly do you want?|
|Are you ready to learn?|
|Been in any good scraps today?|
|Let's not hurt anybody.|
|Make any good deals lately?|
|Long live the cause!|
|Thank you for keeping us safe.|
|Don't let the enemy rest.|
|Don't try to throw your weight around.|
|I have nothing for you.|
|I value your loyalty.|
|It really is a pleasure to speak with you again.|
|It is amazing how far you've come.  Welcome home.|
|It's good to see you have companions to travel with on your adventures.|
|I know you can handle yourself, but be careful out there.|
|Hopefully your friends can dissuade you from this foolishness.|
|Traveling alone in the wilds?!  You know better than that.|
|Only a hero such as yourself can travel at night.  The bogeyman would get me.|
|I know you've seen your share of adventure, but be careful or the bogeyman may get you.|
|Only a fool would travel alone at night!  Take shelter or the bogeyman will get you.|
|Night is falling.  You'd better stay indoors, or the bogeyman will get you.|
|The sun will set soon.  Be careful that the bogeyman doesn't get you.|
|Don't travel alone at night, or the bogeyman will get you.|
|I hate you.|
|I must obey the master!|
|Gwargh!|
|Ahhh...|
|Don't talk to me.|
|Behold, mortal.  I am |
|a divine being|
|.  I know why you have come.|
|Well, let's see...|
|  we've got |
|deaths|
|the death|
|law-breaking|
|the fighting|
|armies on the march|
|the army on the march|
|abductions|
|the abduction|
|occupations|
|the occupation|
|beasts|

|bone-chilling horror|
|ruffians|

|brewing trouble with our neighbors|
|I've forgotten what trouble it was...|
|Wait here until I return.|
|Let's continue onward together.|
|Can you tell me the way to |
|What do you think of me?|
|What can you tell me about yourself?|
|What can you tell me about |
|Can you tell me where I can find |
|Please guide me to |
|We can no longer travel together.|
|  I'm giving up on this hopeless venture.|
|  I'm returning on my own.|
|  I hope you find what you are seeking here.|
|Now we will live under |
|They must be stopped by any means at our disposal.|
|It's not my problem.|
|It was inevitable.|
|This is the life for me.|
|I don't know anything else about them.|
|We are in the right in all matters.|
|It's for the best.|
|I don't care one way or another.|
|I hate them.|
|I am afraid of them.|
|They are terrific.|
|Now we will have to build our own future.|
|Are we close?|
|You are bound to obey me.|
|How are you enjoying the adventure?|
|Where should I take you?|
|Soon the world will be set right.|
|We shall bring |
| home safely.|
|I've forgotten what I was going to say...|

|the skulking vermin|
|the bone-chilling horror|
|the ruffians|
|the open war|

|How have things been?|
|How's life here?|
|It has been the same as ever.|
|The group|
|must be driven off or subjugated.|
|could afford to learn a lesson or two, though open conflict would be unwise.|
|  In any case, peace is no longer an option.|
|  This war must end with our victory.|
|  Their tribute is not enough.|
|  We can no longer pay them homage.|

| is skirmishing with us.|
| is unknown us.|
|and there is friendship between our peoples.|
|and there is no hard feeling between our peoples.|
|but there is ill-will between our peoples.|
|The trouble started because of |
|a dispute over |
|the treatment of animals|
|the treatment of plants|
|torture|
|a formalized agreement|
|truthfulness|
|the devouring of the bodies of sapient beings|
|the display of war and hunting trophies|
|the adversary's inability to communicate and form treaties|
|prior aggression by the adversary|
|a first contact that went horribly wrong|
|the adversary's refusal to form treaties|

| is my |
|It does not help matters that their leader |
|I don't really know.|
|They do not feel challenged at all.|
|They still hold this area, but they do not feel certain.|
|Their strength has been challenged, and their hold has loosened.|
|Their strength has been broken.|
|They consider you an infamous villain among those opposing them.|
|They consider you a leader of the opposition.|
|They consider you a key figure in the opposition.|

|Why are you traveling?|
|Do they have a firm grip on these lands?|
|Where are their forces?  Are there patrols or guards?|
|Does anybody else still have a stake in these lands?|
|Did anybody flee the attack?|
|Tell me about the local ruler.|
|Does this settlement engage in trade?  Tell me about those places.|
|Look at the sky!  Are we in the Underworld?|

|A night creature has infiltrated our communities and now makes prey of us.|
|An evil lurks within.|
|As you know, we are at war.  You might be able to strike our enemies where our armies cannot reach.|
|A great beast threatens to bring ruin upon our people.|
|We have been under siege by an ancient force of nature.|
|It is time to send our cursed enemy back to the underworld.|
|Our people have been tormented by a fearsome foe.|
|A beast horrible beyond imagining threatens us.|
|A creature of the night has our people cowering in fear.|
|The forces of darkness have descended upon us.|
|A terror most foul from the evil depths nigh the underworld plagues us.|
|A vile monster from the bowels of the earth has been preying on our people.|
|A beast from underground has been assailing us.|
|At times, creeping things slither out from below ground.|
|We are besieged by a terrifying monster from the harshest wilderness.|
|A savage beast from the thick of the wilds hunts us at will.|
|A ferocious wild animal has been set on us by nature.|
|A ferocious unnatural beast has become the bane of our people.|
|A beast from the wilds has been harassing our people.|
|Vanquishing a great beast on our behalf would bring us all much glory.|
|Mastering the forces of nature would glorify us in the eyes of the world.|
|Demons from the underworld must not be permitted to walk freely upon the land.|
|Not far from here, a fearsome creature has made its home.|
|Terrible monstrosities live deep under the ground.|
|The world is safer for travelers when night creatures no longer stalk the darkness.|
|A force of evil has arisen in the world.|
|Something truly horrifying has vomited itself forth from the depths of the world.|
|A great monster from the underground is said to have emerged from the darkness.|

|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of peaks required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing enough mid-level elevations.  |
|Can your parameters achieve elevations between 100 and 299?  |
|You might want to adjust the parameters governing elevation frequencies.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of mid-level elevation squares required.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing enough low elevations.  |
|Can your parameters achieve elevations between 0 and 99?  |
|The world generator is having trouble placing enough high elevations.  |
|Can your parameters achieve elevations between 300 and 400?  |
|The world generator is having trouble placing enough ocean squares along the edges.  |
|Can your parameters achieve elevations between 0 and 99 frequently?  |
|You might want to adjust the parameters governing elevation.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of edge oceans required.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing rainfall in the manner specified by the parameters.  |
|You might want to adjust the parameters governing rainfall.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of high, medium or low rainfall squares required.|
|The world generator is having trouble setting drainage in the manner specified by the parameters.  |
|You might want to adjust the parameters governing drainage.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of high, medium or low drainage squares required.|

|You might want to adjust the parameters governing savagery.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of high, medium or low savagery squares required.|
|The world generator is having trouble setting volcanism in the manner specified by the parameters.  |
|You might want to adjust the parameters governing volcanism.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of high, medium or low volcanism squares required.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing enough volcanos.  |
|You might want to check your maximum volcanism value.  |
|Can volcanism be placed at the value 100 enough times to provide space for each of your volcanos?  |
|You might want to check your preset volcanism for the value 100.  |
|You must have at least as many of these highest volcanism points as you are requiring volcanos.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of volcanos required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing swamps and marshes.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, mid-to-high rainfall, low drainage, non-freezing areas.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of swamp squares and regions required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing deserts and badlands.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, very low rainfall, non-freezing areas.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of desert squares and regions required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing forests.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, high rainfall, high drainage, non-freezing areas.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of forest squares and regions required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing mountains.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets can support high elevation areas.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of mountain squares and regions required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing oceans.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets can support low elevation areas.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of ocean squares and regions required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing glaciers.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, very high drainage, freezing areas.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of glacial squares and regions required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing tundra regions.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, low-to-mid drainage, freezing areas.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of tundra squares and regions required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing grasslands.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, low-to-mid rainfall, low-to-mid drainage, non-freezing areas.  |
|The world generator is having trouble placing hills.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, low-to-mid rainfall, high drainage, non-freezing areas.  |
|The world generator is having trouble placing rivers.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many mountain squares as you are requiring river start points.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of rivers required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is placing too many subregions.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets aren't so variable that biomes change frequently.  |
|Alternatively, you can increase the number of subregions permitted by the parameters, up to the cap.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing mountain caves.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many border mountain squares as you are requiring mountain caves.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of mountain caves required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing low-lying caves.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many mid-elevation squares as you are requiring low-lying caves.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of non-mountain caves required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing enough civilizations.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets offer enough low-to-mid savagery, evil/good appropriate, biome appropriate squares to establish sites.  |
|High savagery (66+) blocks civilization placement -- make sure your parameters and presets offer at least small pockets of low-to-mid savagery areas.  |
|If you have very few biome types and are placing good or evil regions, they'll often crowd out the civilizations as well.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of civilizations required by the parameters.|
|The world generator couldn't find any civilization definitions.  |
|This problem cannot be resolved by continuing, so you should either abort or skip all rejects for a legends-only game.  |
|The world generator is having trouble placing a controllable civilization.  |
|Dwarves, for example, require non-evil, non-good, unsavage mountain squares that aren't surrounded by the ocean.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets have adequate squares of this kind.  |
|Alternatively, you can remove the requirement of a controllable civilization from the parameters, which will restrict you to adventurers (assuming an appropriate civilization is placed).|
|The world generator is having trouble placing farming civilizations.  |
|Civilizations use available plants in their surroundings as their initial crops.  |
|Make sure your parameters and raw objects have adequate vegetation.  |

|Tried to call lock a second time before unlock was called. |
|Tried to call a function on a data type that does not allow this type of functionality (ie calling Sound::lock on a streaming sound). |
|Neither NTSCSI nor ASPI could be initialised. |
|An error occurred while initialising the CDDA subsystem. |
|Couldn't find the specified device. |
|No audio tracks on the specified disc. |
|No CD/DVD devices were found. |
|No disc present in the specified drive. |
|A CDDA read error occurred. |
|Error trying to allocate a channel. |
|The specified channel has been reused to play another sound. |
|A Win32 COM related error occured. COM failed to initialize or a QueryInterface failed meaning a Windows codec or driver was not installed properly. |
|DMA Failure.  See debug output for more information. |
|DSP connection error.  Connection possibly caused a cyclic dependancy.  Or tried to connect a tree too many units deep (more than 128). |
|DSP Format error.  A DSP unit may have attempted to connect to this network with the wrong format. |
|DSP connection error.  Couldn't find the DSP unit specified. |
|DSP error.  Cannot perform this operation while the network is in the middle of running.  This will most likely happen if a connection or disconnection is attempted in a DSP callback. |
|DSP connection error.  The unit being connected to or disconnected should only have 1 input or output. |
|An Event failed to be retrieved, most likely due to 'just fail' being specified as the max playbacks behavior. |
|Can't execute this command on an EVENT_INFOONLY event. |
|An error occured that wasn't supposed to.  See debug log for reason. |
|Event failed because 'Max streams' was hit when FMOD_INIT_FAIL_ON_MAXSTREAMS was specified. |
|FSB mismatches the FEV it was compiled with, the stream/sample mode it was meant to be created with was different, or the FEV was built for a different platform. |
|A category with the same name already exists. |
|The requested event, event group, event category or event property could not be found. |
|Error loading file. |
|Couldn't perform seek operation.  This is a limitation of the medium (ie netstreams) or the file format. |

|The specified resource requires authentication or is forbidden. |
|Proxy authentication is required to access the specified resource. |
|A HTTP server error occurred. |
|The HTTP request timed out. |
|FMOD was not initialized correctly to support this function. |
|Cannot call this command after System::init. |
|An error occured that wasn't supposed to.  Contact support. |
|On Xbox 360, this memory address passed to FMOD must be physical, (ie allocated with XPhysicalAlloc.) |
|Value passed in was a NaN, Inf or denormalized float. |
|An invalid object handle was used. |
|An invalid parameter was passed to this function. |
|An invalid speaker was passed to this function based on the current speaker mode. |
|The syncpoint did not come from this sound handle. |
|The vectors passed in are not unit length, or perpendicular. |
|PS2 only.  fmodex.irx failed to initialize.  This is most likely because you forgot to load it. |
|Reached maximum audible playback count for this sound's soundgroup. |
|Not enough memory or resources. |
|Can't use FMOD_OPENMEMORY_POINT on non PCM source data, or non mp3/xma/adpcm data if FMOD_CREATECOMPRESSEDSAMPLE was used. |
|PS2 only.  Not enough memory or resources on PlayStation 2 IOP ram. |
|Not enough memory or resources on console sound ram. |
|Tried to call a command on a 3d sound when the command was meant for 2d sound. |
|Tried to call a command on a 2d sound when the command was meant for 3d sound. |
|Tried to use a feature that requires hardware support.  (ie trying to play a VAG compressed sound in software on PS2). |
|Tried to use a feature that requires the software engine.  Software engine has either been turned off, or command was executed on a hardware channel which does not support this feature. |
|Couldn't connect to the specified host. |
|A socket error occurred.  This is a catch-all for socket-related errors not listed elsewhere. |
|The specified URL couldn't be resolved. |
|Operation on a non-blocking socket could not complete immediately. |
|Operation could not be performed because specified sound is not ready. |
|Error initializing output device, but more specifically, the output device is already in use and cannot be reused. |
|Error creating hardware sound buffer. |
|A call to a standard soundcard driver failed, which could possibly mean a bug in the driver or resources were missing or exhausted. |
|Error enumerating the available driver list. List may be inconsistent due to a recent device addition or removal. |
|Soundcard does not support the minimum features needed for this soundsystem (16bit stereo output). |
|Error initializing output device. |
|FMOD_HARDWARE was specified but the sound card does not have the resources necessary to play it. |
|Attempted to create a software sound but no software channels were specified in System::init. |
|Panning only works with mono or stereo sound sources. |
|An unspecified error has been returned from a 3rd party plugin. |
|The number of allowed instances of a plugin has been exceeded. |
|A requested output, dsp unit type or codec was not available. |
