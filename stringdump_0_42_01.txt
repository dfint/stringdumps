|.  What happened to bring us to this?|
| my neighbor.|
|I don't know |
|One should always respect the law.|
|Society flourishes when law breakers are punished.|
|Nothing gives them the right to establish these laws.|
|No law can do justice to the complexity of life.|
|Some laws are just, while others were made to be broken.|
|Rules are there to be bent, but they shouldn't be flouted thoughtlessly.|
|I consider laws to be more of a suggestion than anything.|
|You must never forget true loyalty.  Repay it in full.|
|How can society function without loyalty?  We must be able to have faith in each other.|
|One must always be loyal to their cause and the ones they serve.|
|Don't serve anyone blindly.  You'll only get into trouble.|
|The whole idea of loyalty is pointless.  Acting purely out of loyalty implies acting against one's own best interest.|
|Never lose yourself in loyalty.  You know what is best for yourself.|
|Loyalty has value, but you should always keep the broader picture in mind.|
|You should only maintain loyalty so long as something more important is not at stake.|
|Consider your loyalties carefully, adhere to them while they last, and abandon them when you must.|
|How great it is to be surrounded by family!|
|You can always rely on your family when everything else falls away.|
|Family is the true bond that keeps society thriving.|
|I was always irritated by family.|
|We cannot choose our families, but we can choose to avoid them.|
|I hold the relationships I've forged myself over family ties I had no part in creating.|
|Family is complicated and those ties be both a boon and a curse.  Sometimes both at once!|
|You can't always rely on your family, but it's good to know somebody is there.|
|There's nothing like a good friend.|
|Surround yourself with friends you can trust and you will be unstoppable.|
|When all other bonds wither, friendship will remain.|
|Be careful of your so-called friends.|
|Friends are future enemies.  I don't see the difference.  People do as they must.|
|Building friendships is a waste.  There is no bond that can withstand distance or a change of circumstance.|
|Friends are nice, but you should keep your priorities straight.|
|Strive for power.|
|Power over others is the only true measure of worth.|
|You can be powerful or powerless.  The choice is yours, until somebody makes it for you.|
|There's nothing admirable about bullying others.|
|It is abhorrent to seek power over other people.|
|The struggle for power must be balanced by other considerations.|
|You should always tell the truth.|
|There is nothing so important that it is worth telling a lie.|
|Everything is so much easier when you just tell the truth.|
|There is no value in telling the truth thoughtlessly.  Consider the circumstances and say what is best.|
|Is there ever a time when honesty by itself overrides other considerations?  Say what is right, not what is true.|
|Don't think about the truth, whatever that is.  Just say what needs to be said.|
|There are times when it is alright not to tell the whole truth.|
|It is best not to complicate your life with lies, sure, but the truth also has its problems.|
|Sometimes the blunt truth just does more damage.  Think about how the situation will unfold before you speak.|
|I do admire a clever trap.|
|There's no value in all of this scheming I see these days.|
|Be shrewd, but do not lose yourself in guile.|
|I do admire a clever turn of phrase.|
|I can appreciate the right turn of phrase.|
|Who are these mealy-mouthed cowards trying to impress?|
|They are so full of all those big words.|
|There is a time for artful speech, and a time for blunt speech as well.|
|Always deal fairly.|
|Don't be afraid to do anything to get ahead in this world.|
|Life isn't fair, and sometimes you have to do what you have to do, but working toward a balance isn't a bad thing.|
|Please maintain your dignity.|
|What do you care how I speak or how I live?|
|I can see a place for maintaining decorum, but it's exhausting to live that way.|
|Some things should never change.|
|It's admirable when the traditions are upheld.|
|We need to find a better way than those of before.|
|We need to move beyond traditions.|
|Some traditions are worth keeping, but we should consider their overall value.|
|Art is life.|
|The creative impulse is so valuable.|
|What's so special about art?|
|Art?  More like wasted opportunity.|
|Art is complicated.  I know what I like, but some I can do without.|
|We should all work together.|
|It's better to work alone when possible, I think.  Cooperation breeds weakness.|
|You should think carefully before embarking on a joint enterprise, though there is some value in working together.|
|I treasure my freedom.|
|Nobody is free, and it is pointless to act as if you are.|
|Personal freedom must be tempered by other considerations.|
|One should not complain or betray any feeling.|
|Do not hide yourself behind an unfeeling mask.|
|There are times when it is best to keep your feelings to yourself, but I wouldn't want to force it.|
|The quest for knowledge never ends.|
|All of that so-called knowledge doesn't mean a thing.|
|Knowledge can be useful, but it can also be pointless or even dangerous.|
|It is important to discover yourself.|
|Why would I waste time thinking about myself?|
|Some time spent in reflection is admirable, but you must not forget to live your life.|
|I think self-control is key.  Master yourself.|
|Why deny yourself your heart's desire?|
|People should be able to control themselves, but it's fine to follow impulses that aren't too harmful.|
|The mind thinks best when the world is at rest.|
|Give me the bustle and noise over all that quiet!|
|I like a balance of tranquility and commotion myself.|
|We should all be as one.  Why all the struggling?|
|We grow through debate and struggle, even chaos and discord.|
|Some discord is a healthy part of society, but we must also try to live together.|
|Be merry!|
|It's great when we all get a chance to be merry together.|
|Bah!  I hope you aren't celebrating something.|
|Merriment is worthless.|
|I can take or leave merrymaking myself, but I don't begrudge people their enjoyment.|
|An artisan, their materials and the tools to shape them!|
|Masterwork?  Why should I care?|
|A tool should get the job done, but one shouldn't obsess over the details.|
|A skilled warrior is a beautiful sight to behold.|
|Why this obsession with weapons and battle?  I don't understand some people.|
|The world isn't always safe.  I can see the value in martial training, the beauty even, but it shouldn't be exalted.|
|We should all be so lucky as to truly master a skill.|
|The amount of practice that goes into mastering a skill is so impressive.|
|Everyone should broaden their horizons.  Any work beyond learning the basics is just a waste.|
|All of that practice is misspent effort.|
|I think people should hone their skills, but it's possible to take it too far and lose sight of the breadth of life.|
|There's more to life than becoming great at just one thing, but being good at several isn't bad!|
|In life, you should work hard.  Then work harder.|
|Hard work is the true sign of character.|
|The best way to get what you want out of life is to work for it.|
|It's foolish to work hard for anything.|
|You shouldn't whittle your life away on working.|
|Hard work is bested by luck, connections and wealth every time.|
|An earnest effort at any required tasks.  That's all that's needed.|
|I only work so hard, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.|
|Hard work is great.  Finding a way to work half as hard is even better.|
|We must be ready to sacrifice when the time comes.|
|Why harm yourself for anybody else's benefit?|
|Some self-sacrifice is worthy, but do not forget yourself in devotion to the well-being of others.|
|It's a competitive world, and you'd be a fool to think otherwise.|
|All of this striving against one another is so foolish.|
|There is value in a good rivalry, but such danger as well.|
|Keep going and never quit.|
|Anybody that sticks to something a moment longer than they have to is an idiot.|
|It's good to keep pushing forward, but sometimes you just have to know when it's time to stop.|
|Wouldn't it be grand to just take my life off and do nothing for the rest of my days?|
|It's best to slow down and just relax.|
|There's work to be done!|
|Time spent in leisure is such a waste.|
|There's some value in leisure, but one also has to engage with other aspects of life.|
|Trade is the life-blood of a thriving society.|
|All of this buying and selling isn't honest work.|
|There's something to be said for trade as a necessity, but there are better things in life to do with one's time.|
|There's nothing like a great romance!|
|These people carrying on about romance should be more practical.|
|You shouldn't get too carried away with romance, but it's fine in moderation.|
|It's wonderful to be out exploring the wilds!|
|I could do without all of those creatures and that tangled greenery.|
|Nature can be enjoyed and used for myriad purposes, but there must always be respect and even fear of its power.|
|Let there be peace throughout the world.|
|How I long for the beautiful spectacle of war!|
|War is sometimes necessary, but peace must be valued as well, when we can have it.|

|It's a great day to fall in love all over again.|
|People do get so carried away sometimes, but not I.|
|Sometimes I just don't like somebody.|
|How can someone be so consumed by hate?|
|I get so jealous sometimes.|
|I don't understand how somebody can become so obsessed by what somebody else has.|
|Be happy!|
|Is there something to be happy about?|
|It really gets me down sometimes.|
|How can people be so glum?|
|I have trouble controlling my temper.|
|People can be so angry, and I just don't understand it.|
|W... worried?  Do I look worried?|
|There's nothing to be upset about.|
|I'm feeling randy today!|
|I just don't understand these flames of passion people go on about.|
|I don't handle pressure well.|
|I'm at my best under pressure.|
|Yes, I want more.  Is that so bad?|
|Why are they so fixated on these baubles?|
|I could really use a drink.|
|So I overindulge sometimes.|
|Sometimes I think I need a drink, but I can control myself.|
|I am not governed by urges.|
|There's nothing like a good brawl.|
|Why must they be so violent?|
|Get me going and I won't stop for anything.|
|Maybe I give up too early sometimes.|
|I don't always do things in the most efficient way.|
|We must be careful not to waste.|
|I don't mind stirring things up.|
|It's so great when everybody just gets along.|
|You're so perceptive!|
|You don't care, so don't ask.|
|I try to live and behave properly.|
|What's this about proper living?|
|I was never one to follow advice.|
|I'm not much of a decision maker.|
|Have no fear.|
|Bravery is not a strength of mine.|
|We will be successful.|
|I don't think I'm cut out for this.|
|I look splendid today.|
|Some people are so wrapped up in themselves.|
|My goals are important to me.|
|I don't feel like I need to chase anything.|
|One should always return a favor.|
|It's not a gift if you expect something in return.|
|I like to dress well.|
|I wouldn't feel comfortable getting all dressed up.|
|Did you hear the one about the |
|That isn't funny.|
|Don't get on my bad side.|
|You shouldn't waste your life on revenge.|
|I am a very, very important person.|
|Oh, I'm nothing special.|
|There's no room for mercy in this world.|
|Show some mercy now and again.|
|I'm concentrating on something.|
|Huh?  What was that?|
|I'm feeling optimistic about the future.|
|It won't turn out well.|
|I'm curious.  Tell me everything!|
|I don't really want to know.|
|I wonder what they think.|
|Who cares what they think?|
|I could tell you all about it!|
|I don't feel like telling you about it.|
|If you have a task, do it properly.|
|It's not perfect, but it's good enough.  Why fret about it?|
|I'm not going to change my mind.|
|Try to keep an open mind.|
|Everybody has their own way of life.|
|I don't understand why they have to be that way.|
|Friendship is forever.|
|I don't really get attached to people.|
|I go with the flow sometimes.|
|Don't bother trying to play on my emotions.|
|I'm happy to help.|
|Why should I help?|
|Do your duty.|
|I don't like being obligated to anybody.|
|Oh, I don't usually think much.|
|One must always carefully consider the correct course of action.|
|Everything just so in its proper place!|
|It's my mess.|
|People are basically trustworthy.|
|My trust is earned, and not by many.|
|It's such a joy to be with people.|
|I prefer to be by myself.|
|People should listen to what I have to say.|
|I try not to interrupt.|
|There's so much to be done!|
|What's the rush?|
|I need some more excitement in my life.|
|I'd just as soon not have anything too exciting happen today.|
|Do you have dreams?  Tell me a story!|
|Try to focus on the practical side of the matter.|
|I encountered a fascinating conundrum recently.|
|A great piece of art is one that moves me.|
|I guess I just don't appreciate art.|
|I cannot stand the world any longer...|
|Everything is all piling up at once!|
|I'm feel like I'm about to snap.|
|I just don't care anymore...|
|I feel so tired of everything.|
|I can't take much more of this!|
|I feel angry all the time.|
|I'm feeling really worn down.|
|It's all starting to get me down.|
|I've been feeling anxious.|
|I get fed up sometimes.|
|I've been under some pressure.|
|I'm doing |

|Ah...  uh...|
|The horror...|
|Rawr!!!|
|Waaaaa...|
|The pain!|
|How incredibly satisfying!|
|Oh joyous occasion!|
|The love overwhelms me!|
|Such sweet bliss!|
|Every last one of you will pay with your lives!|
|Ahhhhhhh!  No!|
|Eek!|
|What is the meaning of it all?!|
|I can't believe how great I feel!|
|That's incredibly suspicious!|
|What's going on?!|
|What's that?!|
|The horror consumes me!|
|I cannot be overwhelmed by grief!|
|Fantastic!|
|I am so enraged!|
|Yes!  It is done.|
|I must not succumb to fear!|
|I feel such unbearable sadness...|
|That was very satisfying!|
|I am so happy!|
|I feel such love!|
|How blissful!|
|I will take revenge!|
|I must press on!|
|I am in complete accord with this!|
|How admirable!|
|Such adoration I feel!|
|How affectionate I am!|
|How agitating!|
|This is so aggravating!|
|The agony is too much!|
|I feel so alienated...|
|Wow!  That's amazing!|
|I am so torn over this...|
|Ha ha!  So amusing!|
|I am so angry!|
|The anguish is overwhelming...|
|How annoying!|
|It's annoying.|
|I'm annoyed.|
|That's annoying.|
|So annoying!|
|I'm so anxious!|
|I could not care less.|
|I am very aroused!|
|Astonishing!|
|I really need to get away from this.|
|I'm awe-struck!|
|I'm terribly bitter about this...|
|This is so boring!|
|I care so much!|
|I'm so incredibly confused...|
|I can't describe the contempt I feel...|
|I am so content about this.|
|I feel so dejected...|
|How very delightful!|
|I despair at this!|
|My disappointment is palpable!|
|How disgusting!|
|How naive I was...  this strikes me to the core.|
|I feel such an intense dislike...|
|Everything is coming apart!|
|I am very, very displeased.|
|What shall I do?  This is a disaster!|
|I can't wait to get to it!|
|Such elation I feel!|
|How embarrassing!|
|I feel such empathy!|
|I feel so empty inside...|
|How enjoyable!|
|So exasperating!|
|How exhilarating!|
|You will know my ferocity!|
|I'm feeling so fond!|
|Such freedom I feel!|
|Such a fright!|
|How frustrating!|
|Glee!|
|The gloom blankets me...|
|How glum I am...|
|I am so grateful!|
|It makes me so grouchy!|
|Not that it's your business!  Harumph!|
|The guilt is almost unbearable!|
|Such happiness!|
|I am consumed by hatred.|
|I am filled with such hope!|
|There is no hope!|
|The humiliation!|
|Such an offense!|
|How incredibly interesting!|
|How irritating!|
|I feel so isolated!|
|Such a jolly time!|
|How jovial I feel!|
|Such jubilation I feel!|
|I crawl with such unbearable loathing!|
|I'm so terribly lonely!|
|I'm overcome by lust!|
|Such misery!|
|The mortification overwhelms me!|
|I am so nervous!|
|Such nostalgia!|
|My optimism is unshakeable!|
|This is such an outrage!|
|I'm panicking!  I'm panicking!|
|My patience is as the still waters.|
|I burn with such passion!|
|How pleasurable!|
|I am so proud!|
|Such total rapture!|
|Such rejection!  I cannot stand it.|
|Such a relief!|
|I have so many regrets...|
|I feel such remorse!|
|I repent!  I repent!|
|I am overcome by such resentment...|
|I feel so restless!|
|I have been so wronged!|
|Why does it keep happening to me?  Why me?!|
|I live to serve...  my dear master...|
|I can't take it!|
|I am so ashamed!|
|I feel such sympathy!|
|The tenderness I feel!|
|It's so thrilling!|
|I feel so uneasy!|
|Such unhappiness!|
|The wonder!|
|I'm so worried!|
|I am filled with such wrath!|
|Nothing shall stand in my way!|
|What am I even doing here?|
|I feel so defeated...|
|I know it will come to pass!|
|I am wracked by doubts!|
|Let's go!|
|This cannot possibly end well...|
|I feel so good!|
|Such gaiety!|
|This is so exciting!|
|That's suspicious!|
|That's alarming!|
|Most shocking!|
|This is truly horrifying.|
|I am almost overcome by grief.|
|This is great!|
|I am about to lose it!|
|It is done.|
|Begone fear!|
|I cannot give in to sadness.|
|I am very satisfied.|
|This is a joyous time.|
|This is love.|
|How blissful I am.|
|I will have my revenge.|
|I am not scared!|
|I accept this.|
|I admire this.|
|I adore this.|
|I'm feeling affectionate.|
|This is driving me to agitation.|
|I'm very aggravated.|
|The agony I feel...|
|I feel alienated.|
|That's amazing!|
|I have strong feelings of ambivalence.|
|That's very amusing.|
|I'm very angry.|
|I feel so anguished...|
|That's very annoying.|
|It makes me very anxious.|
|It would be hard to care less.|
|I'm aroused!|
|It's quite astonishing.|
|I'm very averse to this.|
|Awe-inspiring...|
|It makes me very bitter.|
|It's really boring.|
|I really care.|
|I'm so confused.|
|Contemptible!|
|I'm very content.|
|I'm feeling very dejected.|
|This is delightful!|
|I feel such despair...|
|I am very disappointed.|
|So disgusting...|
|I've become so disillusioned.  What now?|
|I really don't like this.|
|It has all gone wrong!|
|This is quite displeasing.|
|I'm so distressed about this!|
|I'm very eager to get started.|
|I'm so elated.|
|This is so embarrassing...|
|I'm very empathetic.|
|I feel such emptiness.|
|I really enjoyed that!|
|I'm quite exasperated.|
|That was very exhilarating!|
|I'm feeling so ferocious!|
|I'm very fond.|
|I feel so free.|
|That was so frightful.|
|This is very frustrating.|

|I am so happy.|
|The hate burns within me.|

|I'm quite optimistic.|
|This is an outrage!|
|I'm really starting to panic.|
|I'm very patient.|
|I feel such passion.|
|I'm very pleased.|
|I am very proud.|
|I am so spiritually moved!|
|I feel so rejected.|
|I'm so relieved.|
|I'm so regretful.|
|I'm truly remorseful.|
|I must repent.|
|I'm very resentful.|
|I'm really restless.|
|I feel so wronged.|
|This is such a hardship for me!|
|I live to serve.|
|This leaves me so shaken.|
|I feel such shame.|
|I'm very sympathetic.|
|I feel such tenderness.|
|This is quite a thrill!|
|I feel very uneasy.|
|I'm very unhappy.|
|I am filled with wonder.|
|I'm very worried.|
|I am wrathful.|
|I shall accomplish much!|
|What is the meaning of life...|
|I've been defeated.|
|Things are going to happen.|
|I'm very doubtful.|
|I feel enthusiastic!|
|I really don't see this working out.|
|I'm feeling great!|
|The gaiety I'm feeling!|
|This is really exciting!|
|How suspicious...|
|That was alarming.|
|I will master myself.|
|This cannot horrify me.|
|I must let grief pass me by.|
|I feel like a victor.|
|I'm a little angry.|
|It has come to pass.|
|This doesn't scare me.|
|I feel somewhat sad.|
|That was satisfying.|
|This is nice.|
|Is this love?|
|This could be bliss.|
|This might require an answer.|
|I feel no terror.|
|I can accept this.|
|I find this somewhat admirable.|
|I can adore this.|
|That might be affection I feel.|
|This is agitating.|
|This is aggravating.|
|This is agonizing.|
|I feel somewhat alienated.|
|That is amazing.|
|I'm ambivalent.|
|Amusing.|
|That makes me angry.|
|I'm anguished.|
|I'm anxious.|
|Who cares?|
|Arousing...|
|It's astonishing, really.|
|I'd like to get away from it.|
|It fills one with awe.|
|It makes me bitter.|
|It's boring.|
|I care.|
|This is confusing.|
|I feel only contempt.|
|I'm content.|
|I'm dejected.|
|I feel some delight.|
|I feel despair.|
|This is disappointing.|
|That's disgusting.|
|This makes me question it all.|
|I dislike this.|
|What has happened?|
|I am not pleased.|
|This is distressing.|
|I'm eager to go.|
|I'm elated.|
|I'm embarrassed.|
|I feel empathy.|
|I feel empty.|
|I enjoyed that.|
|That was exasperating.|
|That's exhilarating.|
|I burn with ferocity.|
|I feel fond.|
|I'm free.|
|That was frightening.|
|It's frustrating.|
|There's some glee here!|
|I'm a little gloomy.|
|I'm glum.|
|I'm grateful.|
|I'm a little grouchy.|
|Harumph.|
|I feel guilty.|
|I'm happy.|
|I feel hate.|
|I have hope.|
|I cannot find hope.|
|This is humiliating.|
|I take offense.|
|It's interesting.|
|It's irritating.|
|I feel isolated.|
|It makes me jolly.|
|I feel jovial.|
|I feel jubilation.|
|I feel loathing.|
|I'm lonely.|
|I'm lustful.|
|I feel miserable.|
|This is mortifying.|
|I'm nervous.|
|I feel nostalgia.|
|I'm optimistic.|
|It is an outrage.|
|I feel a little panic.|
|I'm patient.|
|I feel passion.|

|My spirit moves.|
|I feel rejected.|
|I'm relieved.|
|I feel regret.|
|I feel remorse.|
|I repent of my deeds.|
|I feel resentful.|
|I feel restless.|
|I've been wronged.|
|Why me?|
|I will serve.|
|This has shaken me.|
|I am ashamed.|
|I'm sympathetic.|
|I feel tenderness.|
|Thrilling.|
|I'm uneasy.|
|I'm unhappy.|
|It's wondrous.|
|It's worrisome.|
|The wrath rises within me...|
|I am ready for this.|
|I just don't know.|
|I'm beat.|
|It could happen!|
|I have my doubts.|
|Let's do this.|
|Things usually don't work out|
|I feel pretty good.|
|This is gaiety.|
|I'm excited.|
|Takes all kinds these days.|
|What is it this time...|
|That did not shock me.|
|I am not upset by this.|
|Grief?  I feel nothing.|
|There is no need for celebration.|
|I have no feelings of rage.|
|I guess it could be considered grimly satisfying.|
|This does not scare me.|
|I am not feeling sad right now.|
|That was not satisfying.|
|I suppose this would be a joyous occasion.|
|There is no love.|
|I do not see the bliss in this.|
|There is no need to feel vengeful.|
|I laugh in the face of death!|
|I do not accept this.|
|There's not much to admire here.|
|I suppose I should be feel adoration.|
|I'm not feeling very affectionate.|
|I don't feel agitated.|
|I'm not feeling aggravated.|
|I can take this.|
|I guess that would be alienating.|
|That wasn't amazing.|
|I guess I should be feeling ambivalent right now.|
|That was not amusing.|
|I'm not angry.|
|This is nothing.|
|No, that's not annoying.|
|I'm not anxious.|
|If I thought about it more, I guess I'd be apathetic.|
|That is not in the least bit arousing.|
|Astonished?  No.|
|I'm not averse to it.|
|I am not held in awe.|
|That's nothing to be bitter about.|
|It isn't boring.|
|I don't care.|
|This isn't confusing.|
|I don't feel contempt.|
|I am not contented.|
|There's nothing to be dejected about.|
|I am not filled with delight.|
|I will not despair.|
|I'm not disappointed.|
|It'll take more than that to disgust me.|
|This won't make me lose faith.|
|I don't dislike that.|
|I'm not dismayed.|
|I feel no displeasure.|
|This isn't distressing.|
|I am not eager.|
|I'm not elated.|
|This isn't embarrassing.|
|I don't feel very empathetic.|
|What's inside me isn't emptiness exactly...|
|I'm not enjoying this.|
|This isn't exasperating.|
|I am not exhilarated.|
|I should be feeling ferocious right now.|
|I am not fond of this.|
|I don't feel free.|
|I guess that could have given me a fright.|
|This isn't frustrating.|
|I'm not gleeful.|
|I'm not feeling gloomy.|
|I don't feel glum.|
|I'm not feeling very grateful.|
|No, I'm not grouchy.|
|That doesn't make me grumpy.|
|I don't feel guilty about it.|
|I am not happy.|
|I feel no hatred.|
|I am not hopeful.|
|I will not lose hope.|
|No, this isn't humiliating.|
|That doesn't insult me.|
|No, I'm not interested.|
|This isn't irritating.|
|I don't feel isolated.|
|I'm not jolly.|
|This doesn't put me in a jovial mood.|
|This isn't the time for jubilation.|
|I am not filled with loathing.|
|I'm not lonely.|
|I am not burning with lust.|
|I'm not miserable.|
|I am not mortified.|
|I don't feel nervous.|
|I'm not feeling nostalgic.|
|I'm not optimistic.|
|This doesn't outrage me.|
|I'm not panicking.|
|I am not feeling patient.|
|I'm not feeling passionate.|
|I take no pleasure in this.|
|I am not proud.|
|This does not move me.|
|I don't feel rejected.|
|I don't feel relieved.|
|I have no regrets.|
|I feel no remorse.|
|I am not repentant.|
|I do not resent this.|
|I don't feel restless.|
|There's nothing to be indignant about.|
|I don't feel sorry for myself.|
|I bow to no one.|
|I can keep it together.|
|I have no shame.|
|There will be no sympathy from me.|
|I don't feel tenderness.|
|There was no thrill in it.|
|I'm not uneasy.|
|That doesn't make me unhappy.|
|There is no sense of wonder.|
|I'm not worried.|
|Wrath has not risen within me.|
|I have no zeal for this.|
|I could be questioning my life right now.|
|This isn't a defeat.|
|I'm not expecting anything.|
|I have no doubts.|
|I'm just not enthusiastic.|
|There's no reason to be pessimistic.|
|I should be feeling great.|
|There is no gaiety.|
|This doesn't excite me.|

|Hey|

|.  It is good to see you.|
| is dumbstruck for a moment.|
|A legend?  Here?  I can scarcely believe it.  |
|I am honored to be in your presence.  |
|It is an honor.  |
|Your name precedes you.  Thank you for all that you have done.  |
|It is good to finally meet you!  |
|Welcome home, my child.|
|.  What can I do for you?|
|You are welcome at |
|.  Please be respectful of the materials.|
|How are you, my |
|It's great to have a friend like you!|
|And what exactly do you want?|
|Are you ready to learn?|
|Been in any good scraps today?|
|Let's not hurt anybody.|
|Make any good deals lately?|
|Long live the cause!|
|Thank you for keeping us safe.|
|Don't let the enemy rest.|
|Don't try to throw your weight around.|
|I have nothing for you.|
|I value your loyalty.|
|It really is a pleasure to speak with you again.|
|Do you have a story to tell?|
|Have you written a new poem?|
|Is it time to make music?|
|Are you still dancing?|
|Are in a foul mood?|
|You'll get nothing from me with your flattery.|
|It is amazing how far you've come.  Welcome home.|
|It's good to see you have companions to travel with on your adventures.|
|I know you can handle yourself, but be careful out there.|
|Hopefully your friends can dissuade you from this foolishness.|
|Traveling alone in the wilds?!  You know better than that.|
|Only a hero such as yourself can travel at night.  The bogeyman would get me.|
|I know you've seen your share of adventure, but be careful or the bogeyman may get you.|
|Only a fool would travel alone at night!  Take shelter or the bogeyman will get you.|
|Night is falling.  You'd better stay indoors, or the bogeyman will get you.|
|The sun will set soon.  Be careful that the bogeyman doesn't get you.|
|Don't travel alone at night, or the bogeyman will get you.|
|I hate you.|
|I must obey the master!|
|Gwargh!|
|Ahhh...|
|Don't talk to me.|
|Behold, mortal.  I am |
|a divine being|
|.  I know why you have come.|
|Well, let's see...|
|  we've got |
|deaths|
|the death|
|law-breaking|
|the fighting|
|armies on the march|

|What can you tell me about yourself?|
|What can you tell me about |
|Can you tell me where I can find |
|Please guide me to |
|We can no longer travel together.|
|  I'm giving up on this hopeless venture.|
|  We were going to entertain the world!  It's a shame, but I'll have to make my own way now.|
|  I'm returning on my own.|
|  I hope you find what you are seeking here.|
|Now we will live under |
|They must be stopped by any means at our disposal.|
|It's not my problem.|
|It was inevitable.|
|This is the life for me.|
|I don't know anything else about them.|
|We are in the right in all matters.|
|It's for the best.|
|I don't care one way or another.|
|I hate them.|
|I am afraid of them.|
|They are terrific.|
|Now we will have to build our own future.|
|Are we close?|
|You are bound to obey me.|
|How are you enjoying the adventure?|
|Where should I take you?|
|Soon the world will be set right.|
|We shall bring |
| home safely.|
|Are you looking forward to the performance?|

|It has been the same as ever.|
|The group|

|could afford to learn a lesson or two, though open conflict would be unwise.|
|  In any case, peace is no longer an option.|
|  This war must end with our victory.|
|  Their tribute is not enough.|
|  We can no longer pay them homage.|

|They do not feel challenged at all.|
|They still hold this area, but they do not feel certain.|
|Their strength has been challenged, and their hold has loosened.|
|Their strength has been broken.|
|They consider you an infamous villain among those opposing them.|

|You dare to flatter me?!|
|How dare you?!|
|Insufferable!|
|You mock me?!|
|  I will settle this my way.|
|  This conversation is over.|
|You insult me with your flattery|
|You insult me with your derision|
|, but let us move on.|
|If you insist so strongly, we can move on.|
|Well, there must be something else to discuss.|
|Fine.  Let's drop the argument.|
|How gracious!|
|You are right.|
|Let's move on.|
|There must be something else to discuss.|
|Let's drop the argument.|
|Yes, let's move on.|
|No!|
|Ha!|
|Eh?|
|Huh?|
|Ack!|
|Uh...|
|How unreasonable!|
|Were you trying to make an argument?|
|Give me a break.|
|Are you being serious?|
|What?|
|Wait, what?|
|What did you just say?|
|Forgive me, but|
|Am I supposed to engage with that?|
|You must be joking.|
|I've heard it all now!|
|Oh, no,|
|That's absurd!|
|that is the stupidest statement I have ever heard.|
|don't waste my time with this drivel.|
|really, I've been over all this nonsense before.|
|I couldn't follow your rambling.|
|I'm having trouble taking you seriously.|
|nobody could possibly believe that.|
|it would amaze me if somebody actually thought that.|
|there's just no way you can believe something so stupid.|
|the things some people think just boggle the mind.|
|you should keep your weird thoughts to yourself.|
|that isn't at all convincing.|
|I'm appalled.|
|Shameful.|
|You're wrong.|
|Unbelievable.|
|Really.|
|It's wrong.|
|I don't want to argue.|
|I don't know what to say.|
|I guess I'm not sure.|
|I disagree.|
|I cannot agree.|
|That's wrong.|
|That's not right.|
|I beg to differ.|
|No.|
|Pause to consider.|
|You are thinking about this all wrong.|
|Stop and reflect.|
|I don't agree.|
|Just think about it.|
|I must insist.|
|No, I mean it.|
|You must be convinced.|
|I require a substantive reply.|
|I sense you're wavering.|
|Well, I believe...  something else.|
|I believe...  something.|
|Help!  Save me!|
|I must withdraw!|

|A night creature has infiltrated our communities and now makes prey of us.|
|An evil lurks within.|
|As you know, we are at war.  You might be able to strike our enemies where our armies cannot reach.|
|A great beast threatens to bring ruin upon our people.|
|We have been under siege by an ancient force of nature.|
|It is time to send our cursed enemy back to the underworld.|
|Our people have been tormented by a fearsome foe.|
|A beast horrible beyond imagining threatens us.|
|A creature of the night has our people cowering in fear.|
|The forces of darkness have descended upon us.|
|A terror most foul from the evil depths nigh the underworld plagues us.|
|A vile monster from the bowels of the earth has been preying on our people.|
|A beast from underground has been assailing us.|
|At times, creeping things slither out from below ground.|
|We are besieged by a terrifying monster from the harshest wilderness.|
|A savage beast from the thick of the wilds hunts us at will.|
|A ferocious wild animal has been set on us by nature.|
|A ferocious unnatural beast has become the bane of our people.|
|A beast from the wilds has been harassing our people.|
|Vanquishing a great beast on our behalf would bring us all much glory.|
|Mastering the forces of nature would glorify us in the eyes of the world.|
|Demons from the underworld must not be permitted to walk freely upon the land.|
|Not far from here, a fearsome creature has made its home.|
|Terrible monstrosities live deep under the ground.|
|The world is safer for travelers when night creatures no longer stalk the darkness.|
|A force of evil has arisen in the world.|
|Something truly horrifying has vomited itself forth from the depths of the world.|
|A great monster from the underground is said to have emerged from the darkness.|
|A vile beast from the caverns now walks the land.|
|A lurking pest has come up from the underground.|
|At the end of the world dwell the fiercest beasts of legend.|
|Creatures grow mighty out in the wildest regions.|
|You might win fame by putting down a wild beast of great renown.|
|Sometimes animals just get out of control.|

|  There is no clear evidence, but there have been so many strange happenings that every honest person in the community now holds it to be true.|
|  None of us are brave enough to level an accusation against the beast, but since you would help us, that is what I ask of you.|

|  It pains me all the more, for the foul villain |

|  Beware!  It it said that only |
|  It is said that |

|  Other arms may not cut so deeply.|
|Our people have been pestered by skulking villains.|
|A marauding warband is threatening our people.|
|Malicious outlaws have brought terror to our doorsteps.|
|Particular outlaws have been causing us much hardship.|
|A sprawling criminal organization has left our people living in fear.|
|A scheming criminal gang has eluded capture for far too long.|

|Command Line: World generation manually aborted.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing enough mountain peaks.  |
|You might want to check your maximum elevation value and other elevation parameters.  |
|Can the elevation 400 be placed enough times to provide space for your peaks?  |
|You might want to check your preset elevations for the elevation 400.  |
|You must have at least as many of these highest elevation points as you are requiring peaks.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of peaks required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing enough mid-level elevations.  |
|Can your parameters achieve elevations between 100 and 299?  |
|You might want to adjust the parameters governing elevation frequencies.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of mid-level elevation squares required.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing enough low elevations.  |
|Can your parameters achieve elevations between 0 and 99?  |
|The world generator is having trouble placing enough high elevations.  |
|Can your parameters achieve elevations between 300 and 400?  |
|The world generator is having trouble placing enough ocean squares along the edges.  |
|Can your parameters achieve elevations between 0 and 99 frequently?  |
|You might want to adjust the parameters governing elevation.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of edge oceans required.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing rainfall in the manner specified by the parameters.  |
|You might want to adjust the parameters governing rainfall.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of high, medium or low rainfall squares required.|
|The world generator is having trouble setting drainage in the manner specified by the parameters.  |
|You might want to adjust the parameters governing drainage.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of high, medium or low drainage squares required.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing savagery in the manner specified by the parameters.  |
|You might want to adjust the parameters governing savagery.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of high, medium or low savagery squares required.|
|The world generator is having trouble setting volcanism in the manner specified by the parameters.  |
|You might want to adjust the parameters governing volcanism.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of high, medium or low volcanism squares required.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing enough volcanos.  |
|You might want to check your maximum volcanism value.  |
|Can volcanism be placed at the value 100 enough times to provide space for each of your volcanos?  |
|You might want to check your preset volcanism for the value 100.  |
|You must have at least as many of these highest volcanism points as you are requiring volcanos.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of volcanos required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing swamps and marshes.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, mid-to-high rainfall, low drainage, non-freezing areas.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of swamp squares and regions required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing deserts and badlands.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, very low rainfall, non-freezing areas.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of desert squares and regions required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing forests.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, high rainfall, high drainage, non-freezing areas.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of forest squares and regions required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing mountains.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets can support high elevation areas.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of mountain squares and regions required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing oceans.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets can support low elevation areas.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of ocean squares and regions required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing glaciers.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, very high drainage, freezing areas.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of glacial squares and regions required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing tundra regions.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, low-to-mid drainage, freezing areas.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of tundra squares and regions required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing grasslands.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, low-to-mid rainfall, low-to-mid drainage, non-freezing areas.  |
|The world generator is having trouble placing hills.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, low-to-mid rainfall, high drainage, non-freezing areas.  |
|The world generator is having trouble placing rivers.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many mountain squares as you are requiring river start points.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of rivers required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is placing too many subregions.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets aren't so variable that biomes change frequently.  |
|Alternatively, you can increase the number of subregions permitted by the parameters, up to the cap.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing mountain caves.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many border mountain squares as you are requiring mountain caves.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of mountain caves required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing low-lying caves.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many mid-elevation squares as you are requiring low-lying caves.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of non-mountain caves required by the parameters.|
|The world generator is having trouble placing enough civilizations.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets offer enough low-to-mid savagery, evil/good appropriate, biome appropriate squares to establish sites.  |
|High savagery (66+) blocks civilization placement -- make sure your parameters and presets offer at least small pockets of low-to-mid savagery areas.  |
|If you have very few biome types and are placing good or evil regions, they'll often crowd out the civilizations as well.  |
|Alternatively, you can reduce the number of civilizations required by the parameters.|
|The world generator couldn't find any civilization definitions.  |
|This problem cannot be resolved by continuing, so you should either abort or skip all rejects for a legends-only game.  |
|The world generator is having trouble placing a controllable civilization.  |
|Dwarves, for example, require non-evil, non-good, unsavage mountain squares that aren't surrounded by the ocean.  |
|Make sure your parameters and presets have adequate squares of this kind.  |
|Alternatively, you can remove the requirement of a controllable civilization from the parameters, which will restrict you to adventurers (assuming an appropriate civilization is placed).|
|The world generator is having trouble placing farming civilizations.  |
|Civilizations use available plants in their surroundings as their initial crops.  |
|Make sure your parameters and raw objects have adequate vegetation.  |

|Scales are constructed from |
| notes spaced evenly throughout the octave.  |
| notes dividing the octave.  |
|In quartertones, their spacing is roughly |
|, where 1 is the tonic, O marks the octave and x marks other notes.  |
|Scales are conceived of as two chords built using a division of the perfect fourth interval into |
| notes.  |
|The tonic note is fixed only at the time of performance.  |
|The tonic note is a fixed tone passed from teacher to student.  |
|Every note is named.  |
|A single note in the fundamental scale is named.  |
|Preferred notes in the fundamental scale are named.  |
|After a scale is constructed, notes are named according to degree.  |

| - Finish peeking in on conversation.|
|It's such a pleasant place you've carved out for yourselves...|
|Let's discuss the state of our current agreements...|
|Well then, we have finalized the export agreement.|

|Well then, we have finalized the import agreement.|
|Remember, trade agreements strengthen bonds.  Please consider an import|

|What requests do you have of our merchants?|
| - Begin discussion.|

|official land of our realm.|
|Do you have any |

| - I can scarcely believe this good news!  I have some recommendations.|

|You continue to impress!  I have come empowered to elevate this land in the|

|We elves are partial in particular to the trees in the forests|
|surrounding your lands.  Although we are loath to spare a|

|that you cap your tree-fells at one hundred until we next meet.|
|I will try to return next year as I am able.|
| - We can grant this request.  Let's discuss the specifics, though...|
| - We cannot stop production just because of your quaint sensibilities.|
