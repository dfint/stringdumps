person
woman
Never!
I will fight no more.
We will fight no more.
I yield!  I yield!
I am overmastered by your presence!
I confess your stunning argument overwhelms me!
I must say that is a truly insightful observation!
I admire how brilliant you are!
I am so nearly swayed by your greatness alone that we can simply assign you the victory!
you needn't indulge my trivial thoughts!
no one can deny your genius!
we can both agree you are by far the most persuasive!
Despite some minor reservations...  
Though I cannot agree fully on a slight technicality,
You know, I think you're right.
I have been so foolish.  Yes, I agree.
you are so clever I must concede!
Although my own insignificant beliefs lie elsewhere,
Ignoring that I don't quite concur...  
Even if I don't change my mind,
Well, there must be something else to discuss.
If you insist so strongly, we can move on.
, but let us move on.
You insult me with your derision
Let's move on.
You are right.
How gracious!
Fine.  Let's drop the argument.
Insufferable!
How dare you?!
You dare to flatter me?!
Base flattery!
You insult me with your flattery
  This conversation is over.
  I will settle this my way.
You mock me?!
Give me a break.
Were you trying to make an argument?
How unreasonable!
Uh...
What did you just say?
Wait, what?
What?
Are you being serious?
No!
Yes, let's move on.
Let's drop the argument.
There must be something else to discuss.
Ack!
Huh?
Eh?
Ha!
nobody could possibly believe that.
I'm having trouble taking you seriously.
I couldn't follow your rambling.
really, I've been over all this nonsense before.
you should keep your weird thoughts to yourself.
the things some people think just boggle the mind.
there's just no way you can believe something so stupid.
it would amaze me if somebody actually thought that.
I've heard it all now!
You must be joking.
Am I supposed to engage with that?
Forgive me, but
don't waste my time with this drivel.
that is the stupidest statement I have ever heard.
That's absurd!
Oh, no,
I cannot agree.
I disagree.
I guess I'm not sure.
I don't know what to say.
No.
I beg to differ.
That's not right.
That's wrong.
You're wrong.
Shameful.
I'm appalled.
that isn't at all convincing.
I don't want to argue.
It's wrong.
Really.
Unbelievable.
I believe...  something.
Well, I believe...  something else.
I sense you're wavering.
I require a substantive reply.
What is this madness?  Calm yourself!
Fool!
I must withdraw!
Help!  Save me!
I don't agree.
Stop and reflect.
You are thinking about this all wrong.
Pause to consider.
You must be convinced.
No, I mean it.
I must insist.
Just think about it.

Nothing gives them the right to establish these laws.
Society flourishes when law breakers are punished.
One should always respect the law.

one of the most loyal soldiers to serve anybody at any time

You should only maintain loyalty so long as something more important is not at stake.
Loyalty has value, but you should always keep the broader picture in mind.
Never lose yourself in loyalty.  You know what is best for yourself.
The whole idea of loyalty is pointless.  Acting purely out of loyalty implies acting against one's own best interest.
Family is the true bond that keeps society thriving.
You can always rely on your family when everything else falls away.
How great it is to be surrounded by family!
Consider your loyalties carefully, adhere to them while they last, and abandon them when you must.
I consider laws to be more of a suggestion than anything.
Rules are there to be bent, but they shouldn't be flouted thoughtlessly.
Some laws are just, while others were made to be broken.
No law can do justice to the complexity of life.
Don't serve anyone blindly.  You'll only get into trouble.
One must always be loyal to their cause and the ones they serve.
How can society function without loyalty?  We must be able to have faith in each other.
You must never forget true loyalty.  Repay it in full.
Friends are nice, but you should keep your priorities straight.
Building friendships is a waste.  There is no bond that can withstand distance or a change of circumstance.
Friends are future enemies.  I don't see the difference.  People do as they must.
Be careful of your so-called friends.
There's nothing admirable about bullying others.
You can be powerful or powerless.  The choice is yours, until somebody makes it for you.
Power over others is the only true measure of worth.
Strive for power.
Family is complicated and those ties be both a boon and a curse.  Sometimes both at once!
I hold the relationships I've forged myself over family ties I had no part in creating.
We cannot choose our families, but we can choose to avoid them.
I was always irritated by family.
When all other bonds wither, friendship will remain.
Surround yourself with friends you can trust and you will be unstoppable.
There's nothing like a good friend.
You can't always rely on your family, but it's good to know somebody is there.
I do admire a clever trap.
Sometimes the blunt truth just does more damage.  Think about how the situation will unfold before you speak.
It is best not to complicate your life with lies, sure, but the truth also has its problems.
There are times when it is alright not to tell the whole truth.
I can appreciate the right turn of phrase.
I do admire a clever turn of phrase.
Be shrewd, but do not lose yourself in guile.
There's no value in all of this scheming I see these days.
There is nothing so important that it is worth telling a lie.
You should always tell the truth.
The struggle for power must be balanced by other considerations.
It is abhorrent to seek power over other people.
Don't think about the truth, whatever that is.  Just say what needs to be said.
Is there ever a time when honesty by itself overrides other considerations?  Say what is right, not what is true.
There is no value in telling the truth thoughtlessly.  Consider the circumstances and say what is best.
Everything is so much easier when you just tell the truth.
We need to find a better way than those of before.
It's admirable when the traditions are upheld.
Some things should never change.
I can see a place for maintaining decorum, but it's exhausting to live that way.
The creative impulse is so valuable.
Art is life.
Some traditions are worth keeping, but we should consider their overall value.
We need to move beyond traditions.
Always deal fairly.
There is a time for artful speech, and a time for blunt speech as well.
They are so full of all those big words.
Who are these mealy-mouthed cowards trying to impress?
What do you care how I speak or how I live?
Please maintain your dignity.
Life isn't fair, and sometimes you have to do what you have to do, but working toward a balance isn't a bad thing.
Don't be afraid to do anything to get ahead in this world.
There are times when it is best to keep your feelings to yourself, but I wouldn't want to force it.
Do not hide yourself behind an unfeeling mask.
One should not complain or betray any feeling.
Personal freedom must be tempered by other considerations.
It is important to discover yourself.
Knowledge can be useful, but it can also be pointless or even dangerous.
All of that so-called knowledge doesn't mean a thing.
The quest for knowledge never ends.
We should all work together.
Art is complicated.  I know what I like, but some I can do without.
Art?  More like wasted opportunity.
What's so special about art?
Nobody is free, and it is pointless to act as if you are.
I treasure my freedom.
You should think carefully before embarking on a joint enterprise, though there is some value in working together.
It's better to work alone when possible, I think.  Cooperation breeds weakness.
Be merry!
Some discord is a healthy part of society, but we must also try to live together.
We grow through debate and struggle, even chaos and discord.
We should all be as one.  Why all the struggling?
I can take or leave merrymaking myself, but I don't begrudge people their enjoyment.
Merriment is worthless.
Bah!  I hope you aren't celebrating something.
It's great when we all get a chance to be merry together.
Why deny yourself your heart's desire?
I think self-control is key.  Master yourself.
Some time spent in reflection is admirable, but you must not forget to live your life.
Why would I waste time thinking about myself?
I like a balance of tranquility and commotion myself.
Give me the bustle and noise over all that quiet!
The mind thinks best when the world is at rest.
People should be able to control themselves, but it's fine to follow impulses that aren't too harmful.
There's more to life than becoming great at just one thing, but being good at several isn't bad!
I think people should hone their skills, but it's possible to take it too far and lose sight of the breadth of life.
All of that practice is misspent effort.
Everyone should broaden their horizons.  Any work beyond learning the basics is just a waste.
It's foolish to work hard for anything.
The best way to get what you want out of life is to work for it.
Hard work is the true sign of character.
In life, you should work hard.  Then work harder.
A skilled warrior is a beautiful sight to behold.
A tool should get the job done, but one shouldn't obsess over the details.
Masterwork?  Why should I care?
An artisan, their materials and the tools to shape them!
The amount of practice that goes into mastering a skill is so impressive.
We should all be so lucky as to truly master a skill.
The world isn't always safe.  I can see the value in martial training, the beauty even, but it shouldn't be exalted.
Why this obsession with weapons and battle?  I don't understand some people.
Keep going and never quit.
There is value in a good rivalry, but such danger as well.
All of this striving against one another is so foolish.
It's a competitive world, and you'd be a fool to think otherwise.
It's best to slow down and just relax.
Wouldn't it be grand to just take my life off and do nothing for the rest of my days?
It's good to keep pushing forward, but sometimes you just have to know when it's time to stop.
Anybody that sticks to something a moment longer than they have to is an idiot.
I only work so hard, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.
An earnest effort at any required tasks.  That's all that's needed.
Hard work is bested by luck, connections and wealth every time.
You shouldn't whittle your life away on working.
Some self-sacrifice is worthy, but do not forget yourself in devotion to the well-being of others.
Why harm yourself for anybody else's benefit?
We must be ready to sacrifice when the time comes.
Hard work is great.  Finding a way to work half as hard is even better.
Nature can be enjoyed and used for myriad purposes, but there must always be respect and even fear of its power.
I could do without all of those creatures and that tangled greenery.
It's wonderful to be out exploring the wilds!
You shouldn't get too carried away with romance, but it's fine in moderation.
Uhh...
War is sometimes necessary, but peace must be valued as well, when we can have it.
How I long for the beautiful spectacle of war!
Let there be peace throughout the world.
Trade is the life-blood of a thriving society.
There's some value in leisure, but one also has to engage with other aspects of life.
Time spent in leisure is such a waste.
There's work to be done!
These people carrying on about romance should be more practical.
There's nothing like a great romance!
There's something to be said for trade as a necessity, but there are better things in life to do with one's time.
All of this buying and selling isn't honest work.

W... worried?  Do I look worried?
People can be so angry, and I just don't understand it.
I have trouble controlling my temper.
How can people be so glum?
I don't handle pressure well.
I just don't understand these flames of passion people go on about.
I'm feeling randy today!
There's nothing to be upset about.
I get so jealous sometimes.
How can someone be so consumed by hate?
Sometimes I just don't like somebody.
People do get so carried away sometimes, but not I.
It really gets me down sometimes.
Is there something to be happy about?
Be happy!
I don't understand how somebody can become so obsessed by what somebody else has.
I don't always do things in the most efficient way.
Maybe I give up too early sometimes.
Get me going and I won't stop for anything.
Why must they be so violent?
You're so perceptive!
It's so great when everybody just gets along.
I don't mind stirring things up.
We must be careful not to waste.
I could really use a drink.
Why are they so fixated on these baubles?
Yes, I want more.  Is that so bad?
I'm at my best under pressure.
There's nothing like a good brawl.
I am not governed by urges.
Sometimes I think I need a drink, but I can control myself.
So I overindulge sometimes.
My goals are important to me.
Some people are so wrapped up in themselves.
I look splendid today.
I don't think I'm cut out for this.
I like to dress well.
It's not a gift if you expect something in return.
One should always return a favor.
I don't feel like I need to chase anything.
I was never one to follow advice.
What's this about proper living?
I try to live and behave properly.
You don't care, so don't ask.
We will be successful.
Bravery is not a strength of mine.
Have no fear.
I'm not much of a decision maker.
Huh?  What was that?
I'm concentrating on something.
Show some mercy now and again.
There's no room for mercy in this world.
I don't really want to know.
I'm curious.  Tell me everything!
It won't turn out well.
I'm feeling optimistic about the future.
That isn't funny.
Did you hear the one about the 
I wouldn't feel comfortable getting all dressed up.
Oh, I'm nothing special.
I am a very, very important person.
You shouldn't waste your life on revenge.
Don't get on my bad side.
I don't really get attached to people.
Friendship is forever.
I don't understand why they have to be that way.
Everybody has their own way of life.
Why should I help?
I'm happy to help.
Don't bother trying to play on my emotions.
I go with the flow sometimes.
I don't feel like telling you about it.
I could tell you all about it!
Who cares what they think?
I wonder what they think.
Try to keep an open mind.
I'm not going to change my mind.
It's not perfect, but it's good enough.  Why fret about it?
If you have a task, do it properly.
I try not to interrupt.
People should listen to what I have to say.
I prefer to be by myself.
It's such a joy to be with people.
I'd just as soon not have anything too exciting happen today.
I need some more excitement in my life.
What's the rush?
There's so much to be done!
One must always carefully consider the correct course of action.
Oh, I don't usually think much.
I don't like being obligated to anybody.
Do your duty.
My trust is earned, and not by many.
People are basically trustworthy.
It's my mess.
Everything just so in its proper place!
I feel angry all the time.
I can't take much more of this!
I feel so tired of everything.
I just don't care anymore...
I get fed up sometimes.
I've been feeling anxious.
It's all starting to get me down.
I'm feeling really worn down.
A great piece of art is one that moves me.
I encountered a fascinating conundrum recently.
Try to focus on the practical side of the matter.
Do you have dreams?  Tell me a story!
I'm feel like I'm about to snap.
Everything is all piling up at once!
I cannot stand the world any longer...
I guess I just don't appreciate art.
Somebody help!
I'm 
just fine
I feel 
Waaaaa...

What's going on?!
That's incredibly suspicious!
I can't believe how great I feel!
What is the meaning of it all?!
Fantastic!
I cannot be overwhelmed by grief!
The horror consumes me!
What's that?!
The love overwhelms me!
Oh joyous occasion!
How incredibly satisfying!
The pain!
Eek!
Ahhhhhhh!  No!
Every last one of you will pay with your lives!
Such sweet bliss!
How admirable!
I am in complete accord with this!
I must press on!
I will take revenge!
This is so aggravating!
How agitating!
How affectionate I am!
Such adoration I feel!
I feel such unbearable sadness...
I must not succumb to fear!
Yes!  It is done.
I am so enraged!
How blissful!
I feel such love!
I am so happy!
That was very satisfying!
So annoying!
That's annoying.
I'm annoyed.
It's annoying.
Astonishing!
I am very aroused!
I could not care less.
I'm so anxious!
I am so torn over this...
Wow!  That's amazing!
I feel so alienated...
The agony is too much!
How annoying!
The anguish is overwhelming...
I am so angry!
Ha ha!  So amusing!
My disappointment is palpable!
I despair at this!
How very delightful!
I feel so dejected...
Everything is coming apart!
I feel such an intense dislike...
How naive I was...  this strikes me to the core.
How disgusting!
This is so boring!
I'm terribly bitter about this...
I'm awe-struck!
I really need to get away from this.
I am so content about this.
I can't describe the contempt I feel...
I'm so incredibly confused...
I care so much!
I'm feeling so fond!
You will know my ferocity!
How exhilarating!
So exasperating!
Glee!
How frustrating!
Such a fright!
Such freedom I feel!
Such elation I feel!
I can't wait to get to it!
What shall I do?  This is a disaster!
I am very, very displeased.
How enjoyable!
I feel so empty inside...
I feel such empathy!
How embarrassing!
Such an offense!
The humiliation!
There is no hope!
I am filled with such hope!
Such a jolly time!
I feel so isolated!
How irritating!
How incredibly interesting!
It makes me so grouchy!
I am so grateful!
How glum I am...
The gloom blankets me...
I am consumed by hatred.
Such happiness!
The guilt is almost unbearable!
Not that it's your business!  Harumph!
I'm panicking!  I'm panicking!
This is such an outrage!
My optimism is unshakeable!
Such nostalgia!
I am so proud!
How pleasurable!
I burn with such passion!
My patience is as the still waters.
I'm so terribly lonely!
I crawl with such unbearable loathing!
Such jubilation I feel!
How jovial I feel!
I am so nervous!
The mortification overwhelms me!
Such misery!
I'm overcome by lust!
I can't take it!
I live to serve...  my dear master...
Why does it keep happening to me?  Why me?!
I have been so wronged!
It's so thrilling!
The tenderness I feel!
I feel such sympathy!
I am so ashamed!
I have so many regrets...
Such a relief!
Such rejection!  I cannot stand it.
Such total rapture!
I feel so restless!
I am overcome by such resentment...
I repent!  I repent!
I feel such remorse!
This cannot possibly end well...
Let's go!
I am wracked by doubts!
I know it will come to pass!
That's suspicious!
This is so exciting!
Such gaiety!
I feel so good!
I'm so worried!
The wonder!
Such unhappiness!
I feel so uneasy!
I feel so defeated...
What am I even doing here?
Nothing shall stand in my way!
I am filled with such wrath!
This is love.
This is a joyous time.
I am very satisfied.
I cannot give in to sadness.
I accept this.
I am not scared!
I will have my revenge.
How blissful I am.
I am almost overcome by grief.
This is truly horrifying.
Most shocking!
That's alarming!
Begone fear!
It is done.
I am about to lose it!
This is great!
I feel so anguished...
I'm very angry.
That's very amusing.
I have strong feelings of ambivalence.
I'm aroused!
It would be hard to care less.
It makes me very anxious.
That's very annoying.
This is driving me to agitation.
I'm feeling affectionate.
I adore this.
I admire this.
That's amazing!
I feel alienated.
The agony I feel...
I'm very aggravated.
I feel such despair...
This is delightful!
I'm feeling very dejected.
I'm very content.
I really don't like this.
I've become so disillusioned.  What now?
So disgusting...
I am very disappointed.
It makes me very bitter.
Awe-inspiring...
I'm very averse to this.
It's quite astonishing.
Contemptible!
I'm so confused.
I really care.
It's really boring.
I'm feeling so ferocious!
That was very exhilarating!
I'm quite exasperated.
I really enjoyed that!
This is very frustrating.
That was so frightful.
I feel so free.
I'm very fond.
I'm very eager to get started.
I'm so distressed about this!
This is quite displeasing.
It has all gone wrong!
I feel such emptiness.
I'm very empathetic.
This is so embarrassing...
I'm so elated.
This is so humiliating.
I feel hopeless.
I am very hopeful.
The hate burns within me.
I feel very isolated.
I'm very irritated by this.
It's very interesting.
I am very insulted.
I'm very grateful.
I feel so glum.
It makes me so gloomy.
I'm so gleeful.
I am so happy.
I feel so guilty.
Harumph!
It makes me very grouchy.
This is an outrage!
I'm quite optimistic.
I'm feeling very nostalgic.
I'm very nervous.
I'm very pleased.
I feel such passion.
I'm very patient.
I'm really starting to panic.
I feel so much loathing...
I feel much jubilation.
I'm very jovial.
I'm feeling so jolly.
I'm so mortified...
I'm so miserable.
I feel such lust.
I'm very lonely.
I live to serve.
This is such a hardship for me!
I feel so wronged.
I'm really restless.
I feel such tenderness.
I'm very sympathetic.
I feel such shame.
This leaves me so shaken.
I'm so relieved.
I feel so rejected.
I am so spiritually moved!
I am very proud.
I'm very resentful.
I must repent.
I'm truly remorseful.
I'm so regretful.
I feel enthusiastic!
I'm very doubtful.
Things are going to happen.
I've been defeated.
This is really exciting!
The gaiety I'm feeling!
I'm feeling great!
I really don't see this working out.
I am filled with wonder.
I'm very unhappy.
I feel very uneasy.
This is quite a thrill!
What is the meaning of life...
I shall accomplish much!
I am wrathful.
I'm very worried.
This is nice.
That was satisfying.
I feel somewhat sad.
This doesn't scare me.
I feel no terror.
This might require an answer.
This could be bliss.
Is this love?
This cannot horrify me.
I will master myself.
That was alarming.
How suspicious...
It has come to pass.
I'm a little angry.
I feel like a victor.
I must let grief pass me by.
That makes me angry.
Amusing.
I'm ambivalent.
That is amazing.
Arousing...
Who cares?
I'm anxious.
I'm anguished.
That might be affection I feel.
I can adore this.
I find this somewhat admirable.
I can accept this.
I feel somewhat alienated.
This is agonizing.
This is aggravating.
This is agitating.
I feel despair.
I feel some delight.
I'm dejected.
I'm content.
I dislike this.
This makes me question it all.
That's disgusting.
This is disappointing.
It makes me bitter.
It fills one with awe.
I'd like to get away from it.
It's astonishing, really.
I feel only contempt.
This is confusing.
I care.
It's boring.
I burn with ferocity.
That's exhilarating.
That was exasperating.
I enjoyed that.
It's frustrating.
That was frightening.
I'm free.
I feel fond.
I'm eager to go.
This is distressing.
I am not pleased.
What has happened?
I feel empty.
I feel empathy.
I'm embarrassed.
I'm elated.
This is humiliating.
I cannot find hope.
I have hope.
I feel hate.
I feel isolated.
It's irritating.
It's interesting.
I take offense.
I'm grateful.
I'm glum.
I'm a little gloomy.
There's some glee here!
I'm happy.
I feel guilty.
Harumph.
I'm a little grouchy.
It is an outrage.
I'm optimistic.
I feel nostalgia.
I'm nervous.
It pleases me.
I feel passion.
I'm patient.
I feel a little panic.
I feel loathing.
I feel jubilation.
I feel jovial.
It makes me jolly.
This is mortifying.
I feel miserable.
I'm lustful.
I'm lonely.
I will serve.
Why me?
I've been wronged.
I feel restless.
I feel tenderness.
I'm sympathetic.
I am ashamed.
This has shaken me.
I'm relieved.
I feel rejected.
My spirit moves.
I'm proud.
I feel resentful.
I repent of my deeds.
I feel remorse.
I feel regret.
Let's do this.
I have my doubts.
It could happen!
I'm beat.
I'm excited.
This is gaiety.
I feel pretty good.
Things usually don't work out
It's wondrous.
I'm unhappy.
I'm uneasy.
Thrilling.
I just don't know.
I am ready for this.
The wrath rises within me...
It's worrisome.
I suppose this would be a joyous occasion.
That was not satisfying.
I am not feeling sad right now.
This does not scare me.
I laugh in the face of death!
There is no need to feel vengeful.
I do not see the bliss in this.
There is no love.
I am not upset by this.
That did not shock me.
What is it this time...
Takes all kinds these days.
I guess it could be considered grimly satisfying.
I have no feelings of rage.
There is no need for celebration.
Grief?  I feel nothing.
I'm not angry.
That was not amusing.
I guess I should be feeling ambivalent right now.
That wasn't amazing.
If I thought about it more, I guess I'd be apathetic.
I'm not anxious.
No, that's not annoying.
This is nothing.
I'm not feeling very affectionate.
I suppose I should be feel adoration.
There's not much to admire here.
I do not accept this.
I guess that would be alienating.
I can take this.
I'm not feeling aggravated.
I don't feel agitated.
I am not filled with delight.
There's nothing to be dejected about.
I am not contented.
I don't feel contempt.
This won't make me lose faith.
It'll take more than that to disgust me.
I'm not disappointed.
I will not despair.
I am not held in awe.
I'm not averse to it.
Astonished?  No.
That is not in the least bit arousing.
This isn't confusing.
I don't care.
It isn't boring.
That's nothing to be bitter about.
I am not exhilarated.
This isn't exasperating.
I'm not enjoying this.
What's inside me isn't emptiness exactly...
I guess that could have given me a fright.
I don't feel free.
I am not fond of this.
I should be feeling ferocious right now.
This isn't distressing.
I feel no displeasure.
I'm not dismayed.
I don't dislike that.
I don't feel very empathetic.
This isn't embarrassing.
I'm not elated.
I am not eager.
I will not lose hope.
I am not hopeful.
I feel no hatred.
I am not happy.
This isn't irritating.
No, I'm not interested.
That doesn't insult me.
No, this isn't humiliating.
I don't feel glum.
I'm not feeling gloomy.
I'm not gleeful.
This isn't frustrating.
I don't feel guilty about it.
That doesn't make me grumpy.
No, I'm not grouchy.
I'm not feeling very grateful.
I'm not optimistic.
I'm not feeling nostalgic.
I don't feel nervous.
I am not mortified.
I'm not feeling passionate.
I am not feeling patient.
I'm not panicking.
This doesn't outrage me.
This isn't the time for jubilation.
This doesn't put me in a jovial mood.
I'm not jolly.
I don't feel isolated.
I'm not miserable.
I am not burning with lust.
I'm not lonely.
I am not filled with loathing.
I don't feel sorry for myself.
There's nothing to be indignant about.
I don't feel restless.
I do not resent this.
There will be no sympathy from me.
I have no shame.
I can keep it together.
I bow to no one.
I don't feel rejected.
This does not move me.
I am not proud.
I take no pleasure in this.
I am not repentant.
I feel no remorse.
I have no regrets.
I don't feel relieved.
I have no doubts.
I'm not expecting anything.
This isn't a defeat.
I could be questioning my life right now.
There is no gaiety.
I should be feeling great.
There's no reason to be pessimistic.
I'm just not enthusiastic.
That doesn't make me unhappy.
I'm not uneasy.
There was no thrill in it.
I don't feel tenderness.
I have no zeal for this.
Wrath has not risen within me.
I'm not worried.
There is no sense of wonder.

The world generator is having trouble placing low-lying caves.  
The world generator is having trouble placing enough civilizations.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of non-mountain caves required by the parameters.
High savagery (66+) blocks civilization placement -- make sure your parameters and presets offer at least small pockets of low-to-mid savagery areas.  
Make sure your parameters and presets offer enough low-to-mid savagery, evil/good appropriate, biome appropriate squares to establish sites.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of civilizations required by the parameters.
If you have very few biome types and are placing good or evil regions, they'll often crowd out the civilizations as well.

[B]The rhythm system is fundamentally polyrhythmic.  There are always multiple rhythm lines, and each of their bars is played over the same period of time, regardless of the number of beats.  The rhythm lines are thought of as one, without a primary-subordinate relationship, though individual lines can be named.

!  Praise the miners!
You have found a curious underground structure.
You have discovered a magma pool.
You have discovered a volcano.
You have discovered a downward passage.
You have discovered a deep pit.
You have discovered an eerie cavern.  The air above the dark stone floor is alive with vortices of purple light and dark, boiling clouds.  Seemingly bottomless glowing pits mark the surface.
You have discovered a cave entrance.
