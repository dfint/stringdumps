Loyalty has value, but you should always keep the broader picture in mind.
You should only maintain loyalty so long as something more important is not at stake.
Consider your loyalties carefully, adhere to them while they last, and abandon them when you must.
How great it is to be surrounded by family!
One must always be loyal to their cause and the ones they serve.
Don't serve anyone blindly.  You'll only get into trouble.
The whole idea of loyalty is pointless.  Acting purely out of loyalty implies acting against one's own best interest.
Never lose yourself in loyalty.  You know what is best for yourself.
Rules are there to be bent, but they shouldn't be flouted thoughtlessly.
I consider laws to be more of a suggestion than anything.
You must never forget true loyalty.  Repay it in full.
How can society function without loyalty?  We must be able to have faith in each other.
Society flourishes when law breakers are punished.
Nothing gives them the right to establish these laws.
No law can do justice to the complexity of life.
Some laws are just, while others were made to be broken.
Building friendships is a waste.  There is no bond that can withstand distance or a change of circumstance.
Friends are nice, but you should keep your priorities straight.
Strive for power.
Power over others is the only true measure of worth.
Surround yourself with friends you can trust and you will be unstoppable.
When all other bonds wither, friendship will remain.
Be careful of your so-called friends.
Friends are future enemies.  I don't see the difference.  People do as they must.
I hold the relationships I've forged myself over family ties I had no part in creating.
Family is complicated and those ties be both a boon and a curse.  Sometimes both at once!
You can't always rely on your family, but it's good to know somebody is there.
There's nothing like a good friend.
You can always rely on your family when everything else falls away.
Family is the true bond that keeps society thriving.
I was always irritated by family.
We cannot choose our families, but we can choose to avoid them.
Sometimes the blunt truth just does more damage.  Think about how the situation will unfold before you speak.
I do admire a clever trap.
There's no value in all of this scheming I see these days.
Be shrewd, but do not lose yourself in guile.
Is there ever a time when honesty by itself overrides other considerations?  Say what is right, not what is true.
Don't think about the truth, whatever that is.  Just say what needs to be said.
There are times when it is alright not to tell the whole truth.
It is best not to complicate your life with lies, sure, but the truth also has its problems.
You should always tell the truth.
There is nothing so important that it is worth telling a lie.
Everything is so much easier when you just tell the truth.
There is no value in telling the truth thoughtlessly.  Consider the circumstances and say what is best.
You can be powerful or powerless.  The choice is yours, until somebody makes it for you.
There's nothing admirable about bullying others.
It is abhorrent to seek power over other people.
The struggle for power must be balanced by other considerations.
It's admirable when the traditions are upheld.
We need to find a better way than those of before.
We need to move beyond traditions.
Some traditions are worth keeping, but we should consider their overall value.
Please maintain your dignity.
What do you care how I speak or how I live?
I can see a place for maintaining decorum, but it's exhausting to live that way.
Some things should never change.
There is a time for artful speech, and a time for blunt speech as well.
Always deal fairly.
Don't be afraid to do anything to get ahead in this world.
Life isn't fair, and sometimes you have to do what you have to do, but working toward a balance isn't a bad thing.
I do admire a clever turn of phrase.
I can appreciate the right turn of phrase.
Who are these mealy-mouthed cowards trying to impress?
They are so full of all those big words.
Do not hide yourself behind an unfeeling mask.
There are times when it is best to keep your feelings to yourself, but I wouldn't want to force it.
The quest for knowledge never ends.
All of that so-called knowledge doesn't mean a thing.
I treasure my freedom.
Nobody is free, and it is pointless to act as if you are.
Personal freedom must be tempered by other considerations.
One should not complain or betray any feeling.
Art is complicated.  I know what I like, but some I can do without.
We should all work together.
It's better to work alone when possible, I think.  Cooperation breeds weakness.
You should think carefully before embarking on a joint enterprise, though there is some value in working together.
Art is life.
The creative impulse is so valuable.
What's so special about art?
Art?  More like wasted opportunity.
Some discord is a healthy part of society, but we must also try to live together.
Be merry!
It's great when we all get a chance to be merry together.
Bah!  I hope you aren't celebrating something.
Give me the bustle and noise over all that quiet!
I like a balance of tranquility and commotion myself.
We should all be as one.  Why all the struggling?
We grow through debate and struggle, even chaos and discord.
I think self-control is key.  Master yourself.
Why deny yourself your heart's desire?
People should be able to control themselves, but it's fine to follow impulses that aren't too harmful.
The mind thinks best when the world is at rest.
Knowledge can be useful, but it can also be pointless or even dangerous.
It is important to discover yourself.
Why would I waste time thinking about myself?
Some time spent in reflection is admirable, but you must not forget to live your life.
I think people should hone their skills, but it's possible to take it too far and lose sight of the breadth of life.
There's more to life than becoming great at just one thing, but being good at several isn't bad!
In life, you should work hard.  Then work harder.
Hard work is the true sign of character.
We should all be so lucky as to truly master a skill.
The amount of practice that goes into mastering a skill is so impressive.
Everyone should broaden their horizons.  Any work beyond learning the basics is just a waste.
All of that practice is misspent effort.
A tool should get the job done, but one shouldn't obsess over the details.
A skilled warrior is a beautiful sight to behold.
Why this obsession with weapons and battle?  I don't understand some people.
The world isn't always safe.  I can see the value in martial training, the beauty even, but it shouldn't be exalted.
Merriment is worthless.
I can take or leave merrymaking myself, but I don't begrudge people their enjoyment.
An artisan, their materials and the tools to shape them!
Masterwork?  Why should I care?
There is value in a good rivalry, but such danger as well.
Keep going and never quit.
Anybody that sticks to something a moment longer than they have to is an idiot.
It's good to keep pushing forward, but sometimes you just have to know when it's time to stop.
Why harm yourself for anybody else's benefit?
Some self-sacrifice is worthy, but do not forget yourself in devotion to the well-being of others.
It's a competitive world, and you'd be a fool to think otherwise.
All of this striving against one another is so foolish.
An earnest effort at any required tasks.  That's all that's needed.
I only work so hard, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.
Hard work is great.  Finding a way to work half as hard is even better.
We must be ready to sacrifice when the time comes.
The best way to get what you want out of life is to work for it.
It's foolish to work hard for anything.
You shouldn't whittle your life away on working.
Hard work is bested by luck, connections and wealth every time.
I could do without all of those creatures and that tangled greenery.
Nature can be enjoyed and used for myriad purposes, but there must always be respect and even fear of its power.
Let there be peace throughout the world.
How I long for the beautiful spectacle of war!
There's nothing like a great romance!
These people carrying on about romance should be more practical.
You shouldn't get too carried away with romance, but it's fine in moderation.
It's wonderful to be out exploring the wilds!
There's some value in leisure, but one also has to engage with other aspects of life.
Trade is the life-blood of a thriving society.
All of this buying and selling isn't honest work.
There's something to be said for trade as a necessity, but there are better things in life to do with one's time.
Wouldn't it be grand to just take my life off and do nothing for the rest of my days?
It's best to slow down and just relax.
There's work to be done!
Time spent in leisure is such a waste.

There's nothing to be upset about.
I'm feeling randy today!
I just don't understand these flames of passion people go on about.
I don't handle pressure well.
How can people be so glum?
I have trouble controlling my temper.
People can be so angry, and I just don't understand it.
W... worried?  Do I look worried?
I don't understand how somebody can become so obsessed by what somebody else has.
Be happy!
Is there something to be happy about?
It really gets me down sometimes.
People do get so carried away sometimes, but not I.
Sometimes I just don't like somebody.
How can someone be so consumed by hate?
I get so jealous sometimes.
We must be careful not to waste.
I don't mind stirring things up.
It's so great when everybody just gets along.
You're so perceptive!
Why must they be so violent?
Get me going and I won't stop for anything.
Maybe I give up too early sometimes.
I don't always do things in the most efficient way.
So I overindulge sometimes.
Sometimes I think I need a drink, but I can control myself.
I am not governed by urges.
There's nothing like a good brawl.
I'm at my best under pressure.
Yes, I want more.  Is that so bad?
Why are they so fixated on these baubles?
I could really use a drink.
I don't feel like I need to chase anything.
One should always return a favor.
It's not a gift if you expect something in return.
I like to dress well.
I don't think I'm cut out for this.
I look splendid today.
Some people are so wrapped up in themselves.
My goals are important to me.
I'm not much of a decision maker.
Have no fear.
Bravery is not a strength of mine.
We will be successful.
You don't care, so don't ask.
I try to live and behave properly.
What's this about proper living?
I was never one to follow advice.
I'm feeling optimistic about the future.
It won't turn out well.
I'm curious.  Tell me everything!
I don't really want to know.
There's no room for mercy in this world.
Show some mercy now and again.
I'm concentrating on something.
Huh?  What was that?
Don't get on my bad side.
You shouldn't waste your life on revenge.
I am a very, very important person.
Oh, I'm nothing special.
I wouldn't feel comfortable getting all dressed up.
Did you hear the one about the 
That isn't funny.
I go with the flow sometimes.
Don't bother trying to play on my emotions.
I'm happy to help.
Why should I help?
Everybody has their own way of life.
I don't understand why they have to be that way.
Friendship is forever.
I don't really get attached to people.
If you have a task, do it properly.
It's not perfect, but it's good enough.  Why fret about it?
I'm not going to change my mind.
Try to keep an open mind.
I wonder what they think.
Who cares what they think?
I could tell you all about it!
I don't feel like telling you about it.
There's so much to be done!
What's the rush?
I need some more excitement in my life.
I'd just as soon not have anything too exciting happen today.
It's such a joy to be with people.
I prefer to be by myself.
People should listen to what I have to say.
I try not to interrupt.
Everything just so in its proper place!
It's my mess.
People are basically trustworthy.
My trust is earned, and not by many.
Do your duty.
I don't like being obligated to anybody.
Oh, I don't usually think much.
One must always carefully consider the correct course of action.
I'm feeling really worn down.
It's all starting to get me down.
I've been feeling anxious.
I get fed up sometimes.
I just don't care anymore...
I feel so tired of everything.
I can't take much more of this!
I feel angry all the time.
I guess I just don't appreciate art.
I cannot stand the world any longer...
Everything is all piling up at once!
I'm feel like I'm about to snap.
Do you have dreams?  Tell me a story!
Try to focus on the practical side of the matter.
I encountered a fascinating conundrum recently.
A great piece of art is one that moves me.
Ah...  uh...

I cannot be overwhelmed by grief!
Fantastic!
What is the meaning of it all?!
I can't believe how great I feel!
That's incredibly suspicious!
What's going on?!
Such sweet bliss!
Every last one of you will pay with your lives!
Ahhhhhhh!  No!
Eek!
The pain!
How incredibly satisfying!
Oh joyous occasion!
The love overwhelms me!

I must press on!
I am in complete accord with this!
How admirable!
That was very satisfying!
I am so happy!
I feel such love!
How blissful!
I am so enraged!
Yes!  It is done.
I must not succumb to fear!
I feel such unbearable sadness...
I'm so anxious!
I could not care less.
I am very aroused!
Astonishing!
It's annoying.
I'm annoyed.
That's annoying.
So annoying!
Ha ha!  So amusing!
I am so angry!
The anguish is overwhelming...
How annoying!
The agony is too much!
I feel so alienated...
Wow!  That's amazing!
I am so torn over this...
How disgusting!
How naive I was...  this strikes me to the core.
I feel such an intense dislike...
Everything is coming apart!
I feel so dejected...
How very delightful!
I despair at this!
My disappointment is palpable!
I care so much!
I'm so incredibly confused...
I can't describe the contempt I feel...
I am so content about this.
I really need to get away from this.
I'm awe-struck!
I'm terribly bitter about this...
This is so boring!
Such freedom I feel!
Such a fright!
How frustrating!
Glee!
So exasperating!
How exhilarating!
You will know my ferocity!
I'm feeling so fond!
How embarrassing!
I feel such empathy!
I feel so empty inside...
How enjoyable!
I am very, very displeased.
What shall I do?  This is a disaster!
I can't wait to get to it!
Such elation I feel!
How incredibly interesting!
How irritating!
I feel so isolated!
Such a jolly time!
I am filled with such hope!
There is no hope!
The humiliation!
Such an offense!
Not that it's your business!  Harumph!
The guilt is almost unbearable!
Such happiness!
I am consumed by hatred.
The gloom blankets me...
How glum I am...
I am so grateful!
It makes me so grouchy!
My patience is as the still waters.
I burn with such passion!
How pleasurable!
I am so proud!
Such nostalgia!
My optimism is unshakeable!
This is such an outrage!
I'm panicking!  I'm panicking!
I'm overcome by lust!
Such misery!
The mortification overwhelms me!
I am so nervous!
How jovial I feel!
Such jubilation I feel!
I crawl with such unbearable loathing!
I'm so terribly lonely!
I am so ashamed!
I feel such sympathy!
The tenderness I feel!
It's so thrilling!
I have been so wronged!
Why does it keep happening to me?  Why me?!
I live to serve...  my dear master...
I can't take it!
I feel such remorse!
I repent!  I repent!
I am overcome by such resentment...
I feel so restless!
Such total rapture!
Such rejection!  I cannot stand it.
Such a relief!
I have so many regrets...
I feel so good!
Such gaiety!
This is so exciting!
That's suspicious!
I know it will come to pass!
I am wracked by doubts!
Let's go!
This cannot possibly end well...
I am filled with such wrath!
Nothing shall stand in my way!
What am I even doing here?
I feel so defeated...
I feel so uneasy!
Such unhappiness!
The wonder!
I'm so worried!
How blissful I am.
I will have my revenge.
I am not scared!
I accept this.
I cannot give in to sadness.
I am very satisfied.
This is a joyous time.
This is love.
This is great!
I am about to lose it!
It is done.
Begone fear!
That's alarming!
Most shocking!
This is truly horrifying.
I am almost overcome by grief.
That's very annoying.
It makes me very anxious.
It would be hard to care less.
I'm aroused!
I have strong feelings of ambivalence.
That's very amusing.
I'm very angry.
I feel so anguished...
I'm very aggravated.
The agony I feel...
I feel alienated.
That's amazing!
I admire this.
I adore this.
I'm feeling affectionate.
This is driving me to agitation.
I am very disappointed.
So disgusting...
I've become so disillusioned.  What now?
I really don't like this.
I'm very content.
I'm feeling very dejected.
This is delightful!
I feel such despair...
It's really boring.
I really care.
I'm so confused.
Contemptible!
It's quite astonishing.
I'm very averse to this.
Awe-inspiring...
It makes me very bitter.
I'm very fond.
I feel so free.
That was so frightful.
This is very frustrating.
I really enjoyed that!
I'm quite exasperated.
That was very exhilarating!
I'm feeling so ferocious!
I'm so elated.
This is so embarrassing...
I'm very empathetic.
I feel such emptiness.
It has all gone wrong!
This is quite displeasing.
I'm so distressed about this!
I'm very eager to get started.
I am very insulted.
It's very interesting.
I'm very irritated by this.
I feel very isolated.
The hate burns within me.
I am very hopeful.
I feel hopeless.
This is so humiliating.
It makes me very grouchy.
Harumph!
I feel so guilty.
I am so happy.
I'm so gleeful.
It makes me so gloomy.
I feel so glum.
I'm very grateful.
I'm really starting to panic.
I'm very patient.
I feel such passion.
I'm very pleased.
I'm very nervous.
I'm feeling very nostalgic.
I'm quite optimistic.
This is an outrage!
I'm very lonely.
I feel such lust.
I'm so miserable.
I'm so mortified...
I'm feeling so jolly.
I'm very jovial.
I feel much jubilation.
I feel so much loathing...
This leaves me so shaken.
I feel such shame.
I'm very sympathetic.
I feel such tenderness.
I'm really restless.
I feel so wronged.
This is such a hardship for me!
I live to serve.
I'm so regretful.
I'm truly remorseful.
I must repent.
I'm very resentful.
I am very proud.
I am so spiritually moved!
I feel so rejected.
I'm so relieved.
I really don't see this working out.
I'm feeling great!
The gaiety I'm feeling!
This is really exciting!
I've been defeated.
Things are going to happen.
I'm very doubtful.
I feel enthusiastic!
I'm very worried.
I am wrathful.
I shall accomplish much!
What is the meaning of life...
This is quite a thrill!
I feel very uneasy.
I'm very unhappy.
I am filled with wonder.
Is this love?
This could be bliss.
This might require an answer.
I feel no terror.
This doesn't scare me.
I feel somewhat sad.
That was satisfying.
This is nice.
I must let grief pass me by.
I feel like a victor.
I'm a little angry.
It has come to pass.
How suspicious...
That was alarming.
I will master myself.
This cannot horrify me.
I'm anguished.
I'm anxious.
Who cares?
Arousing...
That is amazing.
I'm ambivalent.
Amusing.
That makes me angry.
This is agitating.
This is aggravating.
This is agonizing.
I feel somewhat alienated.
I can accept this.
I find this somewhat admirable.
I can adore this.
That might be affection I feel.
This is disappointing.
That's disgusting.
This makes me question it all.
I dislike this.
I'm content.
I'm dejected.
I feel some delight.
I feel despair.
It's boring.
I care.
This is confusing.
I feel only contempt.
It's astonishing, really.
I'd like to get away from it.
It fills one with awe.
It makes me bitter.
I feel fond.
I'm free.
That was frightening.
It's frustrating.
I enjoyed that.
That was exasperating.
That's exhilarating.
I burn with ferocity.
I'm elated.
I'm embarrassed.
I feel empathy.
I feel empty.
What has happened?
I am not pleased.
This is distressing.
I'm eager to go.
I take offense.
It's interesting.
It's irritating.
I feel isolated.
I feel hate.
I have hope.
I cannot find hope.
This is humiliating.
I'm a little grouchy.
Harumph.
I feel guilty.
I'm happy.
There's some glee here!
I'm a little gloomy.
I'm glum.
I'm grateful.
I feel a little panic.
I'm patient.
I feel passion.
It pleases me.
I'm nervous.
I feel nostalgia.
I'm optimistic.
It is an outrage.

I feel miserable.
This is mortifying.
It makes me jolly.
I feel jovial.
I feel jubilation.
I feel loathing.
This has shaken me.
I am ashamed.
I'm sympathetic.
I feel tenderness.
I feel restless.
I've been wronged.
Why me?
I will serve.
I feel regret.
I feel remorse.
I repent of my deeds.
I feel resentful.
I'm proud.
My spirit moves.
I feel rejected.
I'm relieved.
Things usually don't work out
I feel pretty good.
This is gaiety.
I'm excited.
I'm beat.
It could happen!
I have my doubts.
Let's do this.
It's worrisome.
The wrath rises within me...
I am ready for this.
I just don't know.
Thrilling.
I'm uneasy.
I'm unhappy.
It's wondrous.
There is no love.
I do not see the bliss in this.
There is no need to feel vengeful.
I laugh in the face of death!
This does not scare me.
I am not feeling sad right now.
That was not satisfying.
I suppose this would be a joyous occasion.
Grief?  I feel nothing.
There is no need for celebration.
I have no feelings of rage.
I guess it could be considered grimly satisfying.
Takes all kinds these days.
What is it this time...
That did not shock me.
I am not upset by this.
This is nothing.
No, that's not annoying.
I'm not anxious.
If I thought about it more, I guess I'd be apathetic.
That wasn't amazing.
I guess I should be feeling ambivalent right now.
That was not amusing.
I'm not angry.
I don't feel agitated.
I'm not feeling aggravated.
I can take this.
I guess that would be alienating.
I do not accept this.
There's not much to admire here.
I suppose I should be feel adoration.
I'm not feeling very affectionate.
I will not despair.
I'm not disappointed.
It'll take more than that to disgust me.
This won't make me lose faith.
I don't feel contempt.
I am not contented.
There's nothing to be dejected about.
I am not filled with delight.
That's nothing to be bitter about.
It isn't boring.
I don't care.
This isn't confusing.
That is not in the least bit arousing.
Astonished?  No.
I'm not averse to it.
I am not held in awe.
I should be feeling ferocious right now.
I am not fond of this.
I don't feel free.
I guess that could have given me a fright.
What's inside me isn't emptiness exactly...
I'm not enjoying this.
This isn't exasperating.
I am not exhilarated.
I am not eager.
I'm not elated.
This isn't embarrassing.
I don't feel very empathetic.
I don't dislike that.
I'm not dismayed.
I feel no displeasure.
This isn't distressing.
No, this isn't humiliating.
That doesn't insult me.
No, I'm not interested.
This isn't irritating.
I am not happy.
I feel no hatred.
I am not hopeful.
I will not lose hope.
I'm not feeling very grateful.
No, I'm not grouchy.
That doesn't make me grumpy.
I don't feel guilty about it.
This isn't frustrating.
I'm not gleeful.
I'm not feeling gloomy.
I don't feel glum.
This doesn't outrage me.
I'm not panicking.
I am not feeling patient.
I'm not feeling passionate.
I am not mortified.
I don't feel nervous.
I'm not feeling nostalgic.
I'm not optimistic.
I am not filled with loathing.
I'm not lonely.
I am not burning with lust.
I'm not miserable.
I don't feel isolated.
I'm not jolly.
This doesn't put me in a jovial mood.
This isn't the time for jubilation.
I bow to no one.
I can keep it together.
I have no shame.
There will be no sympathy from me.
I do not resent this.
I don't feel restless.
There's nothing to be indignant about.
I don't feel sorry for myself.
I don't feel relieved.
I have no regrets.
I feel no remorse.
I am not repentant.
I take no pleasure in this.
I am not proud.
This does not move me.
I don't feel rejected.
I'm just not enthusiastic.
There's no reason to be pessimistic.
I should be feeling great.
There is no gaiety.
I could be questioning my life right now.
This isn't a defeat.
I'm not expecting anything.
I have no doubts.
There is no sense of wonder.
I'm not worried.
Wrath has not risen within me.
I have no zeal for this.
I don't feel tenderness.
There was no thrill in it.
I'm not uneasy.
That doesn't make me unhappy.

The world generator is having trouble placing a controllable civilization.  
Dwarves, for example, require non-evil, non-good, unsavage mountain squares that aren't surrounded by the ocean.  
The world generator couldn't find any civilization definitions.  
This problem cannot be resolved by continuing, so you should either abort or skip all rejects for a legends-only game.  
The world generator is having trouble placing farming civilizations.  
Civilizations use available plants in their surroundings as their initial crops.  
Make sure your parameters and presets have adequate squares of this kind.  
Alternatively, you can remove the requirement of a controllable civilization from the parameters, which will restrict you to adventurers (assuming an appropriate civilization is placed).

The world generator is placing too many subregions.  
Make sure your parameters and presets aren't so variable that biomes change frequently.  
Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many mountain squares as you are requiring river start points.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of rivers required by the parameters.
Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many border mountain squares as you are requiring mountain caves.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of mountain caves required by the parameters.
Alternatively, you can increase the number of subregions permitted by the parameters, up to the cap.
The world generator is having trouble placing mountain caves.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of non-mountain caves required by the parameters.
The world generator is having trouble placing enough civilizations.  
The world generator is having trouble placing low-lying caves.  
Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many mid-elevation squares as you are requiring low-lying caves.  
If you have very few biome types and are placing good or evil regions, they'll often crowd out the civilizations as well.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of civilizations required by the parameters.
Make sure your parameters and presets offer enough low-to-mid savagery, evil/good appropriate, biome appropriate squares to establish sites.  
High savagery (66+) blocks civilization placement -- make sure your parameters and presets offer at least small pockets of low-to-mid savagery areas.
