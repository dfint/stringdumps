Never!
I will fight no more.
Okay!  I'll do it.
You first, coward!
We yield!  We yield!
Stop!  This isn't happening!
We will fight no more.
I yield!  I yield!
Yes, I can see it clearly now.
Maybe you're right.
You know, I think you're right.
I have been so foolish.  Yes, I agree.
 drops

I am compelled to continue!
Over my dead body!
you are so clever I must concede!
Although my own insignificant beliefs lie elsewhere,
I must say that is a truly insightful observation!
I admire how brilliant you are!
Despite some minor reservations...  
Though I cannot agree fully on a slight technicality,
Ignoring that I don't quite concur...  
Even if I don't change my mind,
I am so nearly swayed by your greatness alone that we can simply assign you the victory!
you needn't indulge my trivial thoughts!
You dare to flatter me?!
Base flattery!
I am overmastered by your presence!
I confess your stunning argument overwhelms me!
no one can deny your genius!
we can both agree you are by far the most persuasive!
You insult me with your flattery
  This conversation is over.
, but let us move on.
You insult me with your derision
Insufferable!
How dare you?!
  I will settle this my way.
You mock me?!
Let's move on.
You are right.
Let's drop the argument.
There must be something else to discuss.
Well, there must be something else to discuss.
If you insist so strongly, we can move on.
How gracious!
Fine.  Let's drop the argument.
Ack!
Huh?
How unreasonable!
Uh...
No!
Yes, let's move on.
Eh?
Ha!
What did you just say?
Wait, what?
Am I supposed to engage with that?
Forgive me, but
Give me a break.
Were you trying to make an argument?
What?
Are you being serious?
don't waste my time with this drivel.
that is the stupidest statement I have ever heard.
I couldn't follow your rambling.
really, I've been over all this nonsense before.
I've heard it all now!
You must be joking.
That's absurd!
Oh, no,
you should keep your weird thoughts to yourself.
the things some people think just boggle the mind.
I'm appalled.
that isn't at all convincing.
nobody could possibly believe that.
I'm having trouble taking you seriously.
there's just no way you can believe something so stupid.
it would amaze me if somebody actually thought that.
I just don't know.
It's wrong.
I don't know what to say.
I don't want to argue.
You're wrong.
Shameful.
Really.
Unbelievable.
I beg to differ.
That's not right.
Pause to consider.
No.
I disagree.
I guess I'm not sure.
That's wrong.
I cannot agree.
No, I mean it.
I must insist.
I require a substantive reply.
You must be convinced.
Stop and reflect.
You are thinking about this all wrong.
Just think about it.
I don't agree.
Fool!
I must withdraw!
What is this madness?  Calm yourself!
Well, I believe...  something else.
I sense you're wavering.
Help!  Save me!
I believe...  something.

Don't serve anyone blindly.  You'll only get into trouble.
The whole idea of loyalty is pointless.  Acting purely out of loyalty implies acting against one's own best interest.
Never lose yourself in loyalty.  You know what is best for yourself.
Loyalty has value, but you should always keep the broader picture in mind.
I consider laws to be more of a suggestion than anything.
You must never forget true loyalty.  Repay it in full.
How can society function without loyalty?  We must be able to have faith in each other.
One must always be loyal to their cause and the ones they serve.
Nothing gives them the right to establish these laws.
No law can do justice to the complexity of life.
Some laws are just, while others were made to be broken.
Rules are there to be bent, but they shouldn't be flouted thoughtlessly.
 my neighbor.
I don't know 
One should always respect the law.
Society flourishes when law breakers are punished.
When all other bonds wither, friendship will remain.
Be careful of your so-called friends.
Friends are future enemies.  I don't see the difference.  People do as they must.
Building friendships is a waste.  There is no bond that can withstand distance or a change of circumstance.
Family is complicated and those ties be both a boon and a curse.  Sometimes both at once!
You can't always rely on your family, but it's good to know somebody is there.
There's nothing like a good friend.
Surround yourself with friends you can trust and you will be unstoppable.
Family is the true bond that keeps society thriving.
I was always irritated by family.
We cannot choose our families, but we can choose to avoid them.
I hold the relationships I've forged myself over family ties I had no part in creating.
You should only maintain loyalty so long as something more important is not at stake.
Consider your loyalties carefully, adhere to them while they last, and abandon them when you must.
How great it is to be surrounded by family!
You can always rely on your family when everything else falls away.
Don't think about the truth, whatever that is.  Just say what needs to be said.
There are times when it is alright not to tell the whole truth.
It is best not to complicate your life with lies, sure, but the truth also has its problems.
Sometimes the blunt truth just does more damage.  Think about how the situation will unfold before you speak.
There is nothing so important that it is worth telling a lie.
Everything is so much easier when you just tell the truth.
There is no value in telling the truth thoughtlessly.  Consider the circumstances and say what is best.
Is there ever a time when honesty by itself overrides other considerations?  Say what is right, not what is true.
There's nothing admirable about bullying others.
It is abhorrent to seek power over other people.
The struggle for power must be balanced by other considerations.
You should always tell the truth.
Friends are nice, but you should keep your priorities straight.
Strive for power.
Power over others is the only true measure of worth.
You can be powerful or powerless.  The choice is yours, until somebody makes it for you.
What do you care how I speak or how I live?
I can see a place for maintaining decorum, but it's exhausting to live that way.
Some things should never change.
It's admirable when the traditions are upheld.
Always deal fairly.
Don't be afraid to do anything to get ahead in this world.
Life isn't fair, and sometimes you have to do what you have to do, but working toward a balance isn't a bad thing.
Please maintain your dignity.
I can appreciate the right turn of phrase.
Who are these mealy-mouthed cowards trying to impress?
They are so full of all those big words.
There is a time for artful speech, and a time for blunt speech as well.
I do admire a clever trap.
There's no value in all of this scheming I see these days.
Be shrewd, but do not lose yourself in guile.
I do admire a clever turn of phrase.
Nobody is free, and it is pointless to act as if you are.
Personal freedom must be tempered by other considerations.
One should not complain or betray any feeling.
Do not hide yourself behind an unfeeling mask.
We should all work together.
It's better to work alone when possible, I think.  Cooperation breeds weakness.
You should think carefully before embarking on a joint enterprise, though there is some value in working together.
I treasure my freedom.
The creative impulse is so valuable.
What's so special about art?
Art?  More like wasted opportunity.
Art is complicated.  I know what I like, but some I can do without.
We need to find a better way than those of before.
We need to move beyond traditions.
Some traditions are worth keeping, but we should consider their overall value.
Art is life.
I like a balance of tranquility and commotion myself.
We should all be as one.  Why all the struggling?
We grow through debate and struggle, even chaos and discord.
Some discord is a healthy part of society, but we must also try to live together.
Why deny yourself your heart's desire?
People should be able to control themselves, but it's fine to follow impulses that aren't too harmful.
The mind thinks best when the world is at rest.
Give me the bustle and noise over all that quiet!
It is important to discover yourself.
Why would I waste time thinking about myself?
Some time spent in reflection is admirable, but you must not forget to live your life.
I think self-control is key.  Master yourself.
There are times when it is best to keep your feelings to yourself, but I wouldn't want to force it.
The quest for knowledge never ends.
All of that so-called knowledge doesn't mean a thing.
Knowledge can be useful, but it can also be pointless or even dangerous.
The amount of practice that goes into mastering a skill is so impressive.
Everyone should broaden their horizons.  Any work beyond learning the basics is just a waste.
All of that practice is misspent effort.
I think people should hone their skills, but it's possible to take it too far and lose sight of the breadth of life.
A skilled warrior is a beautiful sight to behold.
Why this obsession with weapons and battle?  I don't understand some people.
The world isn't always safe.  I can see the value in martial training, the beauty even, but it shouldn't be exalted.
We should all be so lucky as to truly master a skill.
I can take or leave merrymaking myself, but I don't begrudge people their enjoyment.
An artisan, their materials and the tools to shape them!
Masterwork?  Why should I care?
A tool should get the job done, but one shouldn't obsess over the details.
Be merry!
It's great when we all get a chance to be merry together.
Bah!  I hope you aren't celebrating something.
Merriment is worthless.
Some self-sacrifice is worthy, but do not forget yourself in devotion to the well-being of others.
It's a competitive world, and you'd be a fool to think otherwise.
All of this striving against one another is so foolish.
There is value in a good rivalry, but such danger as well.
I only work so hard, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.
Hard work is great.  Finding a way to work half as hard is even better.
We must be ready to sacrifice when the time comes.
Why harm yourself for anybody else's benefit?
It's foolish to work hard for anything.
You shouldn't whittle your life away on working.
Hard work is bested by luck, connections and wealth every time.
An earnest effort at any required tasks.  That's all that's needed.
There's more to life than becoming great at just one thing, but being good at several isn't bad!
In life, you should work hard.  Then work harder.
Hard work is the true sign of character.
The best way to get what you want out of life is to work for it.
These people carrying on about romance should be more practical.
You shouldn't get too carried away with romance, but it's fine in moderation.
It's wonderful to be out exploring the wilds!
I could do without all of those creatures and that tangled greenery.
Trade is the life-blood of a thriving society.
All of this buying and selling isn't honest work.
There's something to be said for trade as a necessity, but there are better things in life to do with one's time.
There's nothing like a great romance!
It's best to slow down and just relax.
There's work to be done!
Time spent in leisure is such a waste.
There's some value in leisure, but one also has to engage with other aspects of life.
Keep going and never quit.
Anybody that sticks to something a moment longer than they have to is an idiot.
It's good to keep pushing forward, but sometimes you just have to know when it's time to stop.
Wouldn't it be grand to just take my life off and do nothing for the rest of my days?
the idea of
the theme of
It's a great day to fall in love all over again.
People do get so carried away sometimes, but not I.
considering

the subject of

Nature can be enjoyed and used for myriad purposes, but there must always be respect and even fear of its power.
Let there be peace throughout the world.
How I long for the beautiful spectacle of war!
War is sometimes necessary, but peace must be valued as well, when we can have it.
I'm feeling randy today!
I just don't understand these flames of passion people go on about.
I don't handle pressure well.
I'm at my best under pressure.
I have trouble controlling my temper.
People can be so angry, and I just don't understand it.
W... worried?  Do I look worried?
There's nothing to be upset about.
Be happy!
Is there something to be happy about?
It really gets me down sometimes.
How can people be so glum?
Sometimes I just don't like somebody.
How can someone be so consumed by hate?
I get so jealous sometimes.
I don't understand how somebody can become so obsessed by what somebody else has.
I don't mind stirring things up.
It's so great when everybody just gets along.
You're so perceptive!
You don't care, so don't ask.
Get me going and I won't stop for anything.
Maybe I give up too early sometimes.
I don't always do things in the most efficient way.
We must be careful not to waste.
Sometimes I think I need a drink, but I can control myself.
I am not governed by urges.
There's nothing like a good brawl.
Why must they be so violent?
Yes, I want more.  Is that so bad?
Why are they so fixated on these baubles?
I could really use a drink.
So I overindulge sometimes.
One should always return a favor.
It's not a gift if you expect something in return.
I like to dress well.
I wouldn't feel comfortable getting all dressed up.
I look splendid today.
Some people are so wrapped up in themselves.
My goals are important to me.
I don't feel like I need to chase anything.
Have no fear.
Bravery is not a strength of mine.
We will be successful.
I don't think I'm cut out for this.
I try to live and behave properly.
What's this about proper living?
I was never one to follow advice.
I'm not much of a decision maker.
I'm curious.  Tell me everything!
I don't really want to know.
I wonder what they think.
Who cares what they think?
I'm concentrating on something.
Huh?  What was that?
I'm feeling optimistic about the future.
It won't turn out well.
I am a very, very important person.
Oh, I'm nothing special.
There's no room for mercy in this world.
Show some mercy now and again.
Did you hear the one about the 
That isn't funny.
Don't get on my bad side.
You shouldn't waste your life on revenge.
I'm happy to help.
Why should I help?
Do your duty.
I don't like being obligated to anybody.
Friendship is forever.
I don't really get attached to people.
I go with the flow sometimes.
Don't bother trying to play on my emotions.
I'm not going to change my mind.
Try to keep an open mind.
Everybody has their own way of life.
I don't understand why they have to be that way.
I could tell you all about it!
I don't feel like telling you about it.
If you have a task, do it properly.
It's not perfect, but it's good enough.  Why fret about it?
I need some more excitement in my life.
I'd just as soon not have anything too exciting happen today.
Do you have dreams?  Tell me a story!
Try to focus on the practical side of the matter.
People should listen to what I have to say.
I try not to interrupt.
There's so much to be done!
What's the rush?
People are basically trustworthy.
My trust is earned, and not by many.
It's such a joy to be with people.
I prefer to be by myself.
Oh, I don't usually think much.
One must always carefully consider the correct course of action.
Everything just so in its proper place!
It's my mess.
I've been feeling anxious.
I get fed up sometimes.
I've been under some pressure.
I'm doing 
I can't take much more of this!
I feel angry all the time.
I'm feeling really worn down.
It's all starting to get me down.
Everything is all piling up at once!
I'm feel like I'm about to snap.
I just don't care anymore...
I feel so tired of everything.
I encountered a fascinating conundrum recently.
A great piece of art is one that moves me.
I guess I just don't appreciate art.
I cannot stand the world any longer...
Rawr!!!
Waaaaa...
The pain!
How incredibly satisfying!
I'm 
Somebody help!
Ah...  uh...
The horror...
good
I've been 
I feel 
just fine
fine
well
alright
Everything's 
I cannot be overwhelmed by grief!
Fantastic!
I am so enraged!
Yes!  It is done.
That's incredibly suspicious!
What's going on?!
What's that?!
The horror consumes me!
Ahhhhhhh!  No!
Eek!
What is the meaning of it all?!
I can't believe how great I feel!
Oh joyous occasion!
The love overwhelms me!
Such sweet bliss!
Every last one of you will pay with your lives!
How agitating!
This is so aggravating!
The agony is too much!
I feel so alienated...
I am in complete accord with this!
How admirable!
Such adoration I feel!
How affectionate I am!
I feel such love!
How blissful!
I will take revenge!
I must press on!
I must not succumb to fear!
I feel such unbearable sadness...
That was very satisfying!
I am so happy!
I am very aroused!
Astonishing!
I really need to get away from this.
I'm awe-struck!
That's annoying.
So annoying!
I'm so anxious!
I could not care less.
The anguish is overwhelming...
How annoying!
It's annoying.
I'm annoyed.
Wow!  That's amazing!
I am so torn over this...
Ha ha!  So amusing!
I am so angry!
I feel such an intense dislike...
Everything is coming apart!
I am very, very displeased.
What shall I do?  This is a disaster!
I despair at this!
My disappointment is palpable!
How disgusting!
How naive I was...  this strikes me to the core.
I can't describe the contempt I feel...
I am so content about this.
I feel so dejected...
How very delightful!
I'm terribly bitter about this...
This is so boring!
I care so much!
I'm so incredibly confused...
How frustrating!
Glee!
The gloom blankets me...

You will know my ferocity!
I'm feeling so fond!
Such freedom I feel!
Such a fright!
I feel so empty inside...
How enjoyable!
So exasperating!
How exhilarating!
I can't wait to get to it!
Such elation I feel!
How embarrassing!
I feel such empathy!
I feel so isolated!
Such a jolly time!
How jovial I feel!
Such jubilation I feel!
The humiliation!
Such an offense!
How incredibly interesting!
How irritating!
Such happiness!
I am consumed by hatred.
I am filled with such hope!
There is no hope!
I am so grateful!
It makes me so grouchy!
Not that it's your business!  Harumph!
The guilt is almost unbearable!
How pleasurable!
I am so proud!
Such total rapture!
Such rejection!  I cannot stand it.
This is such an outrage!
I'm panicking!  I'm panicking!
My patience is as the still waters.
I burn with such passion!
The mortification overwhelms me!
I am so nervous!
Such nostalgia!
My optimism is unshakeable!
I crawl with such unbearable loathing!
I'm so terribly lonely!
I'm overcome by lust!
Such misery!
The tenderness I feel!
It's so thrilling!
I feel so uneasy!
Such unhappiness!
I live to serve...  my dear master...
I can't take it!
I am so ashamed!
I feel such sympathy!
I am overcome by such resentment...
I feel so restless!
I have been so wronged!
Why does it keep happening to me?  Why me?!
Such a relief!
I have so many regrets...
I feel such remorse!
I repent!  I repent!
This is so exciting!
That's suspicious!
That's alarming!
Most shocking!
Let's go!
This cannot possibly end well...
I feel so good!
Such gaiety!
What am I even doing here?
I feel so defeated...
I know it will come to pass!
I am wracked by doubts!
The wonder!
I'm so worried!
I am filled with such wrath!
Nothing shall stand in my way!
I am not scared!
I accept this.
I admire this.
I adore this.
This is a joyous time.
This is love.
How blissful I am.
I will have my revenge.
It is done.
Begone fear!
I cannot give in to sadness.
I am very satisfied.
This is truly horrifying.
I am almost overcome by grief.
This is great!
I am about to lose it!
It would be hard to care less.
I'm aroused!
It's quite astonishing.
I'm very averse to this.
I'm very angry.
I feel so anguished...
That's very annoying.
It makes me very anxious.
I feel alienated.
That's amazing!
I have strong feelings of ambivalence.
That's very amusing.
I'm feeling affectionate.
This is driving me to agitation.
I'm very aggravated.
The agony I feel...
I've become so disillusioned.  What now?
I really don't like this.
It has all gone wrong!
This is quite displeasing.
This is delightful!
I feel such despair...
I am very disappointed.
So disgusting...
I'm so confused.
Contemptible!
I'm very content.
I'm feeling very dejected.
Awe-inspiring...
It makes me very bitter.
It's really boring.
I really care.
That was so frightful.
This is very frustrating.
I'm so gleeful.
It makes me so gloomy.
That was very exhilarating!
I'm feeling so ferocious!
I'm very fond.
I feel so free.
I'm very empathetic.
I feel such emptiness.
I really enjoyed that!
I'm quite exasperated.
I'm so distressed about this!
I'm very eager to get started.
I'm so elated.
This is so embarrassing...
I'm very irritated by this.
I feel very isolated.
I'm feeling so jolly.
I'm very jovial.
I feel hopeless.
This is so humiliating.
I am very insulted.
It's very interesting.
I feel so guilty.
I am so happy.
The hate burns within me.
I am very hopeful.

I'm very grateful.
It makes me very grouchy.
Harumph!
I feel such passion.

This is an outrage!
I'm really starting to panic.
I'm very patient.

I must repent.
I'm very resentful.
I'm really restless.
I feel so wronged.
I feel so rejected.
I'm so relieved.
I'm so regretful.
I'm truly remorseful.
The gaiety I'm feeling!
This is really exciting!
How suspicious...
That was alarming.
I'm very doubtful.
I feel enthusiastic!
I really don't see this working out.
I'm feeling great!
I shall accomplish much!
What is the meaning of life...
I've been defeated.
Things are going to happen.
I'm very unhappy.
I am filled with wonder.
I'm very worried.
I am wrathful.
This might require an answer.
I feel no terror.
I can accept this.
I find this somewhat admirable.
That was satisfying.
This is nice.
Is this love?
This could be bliss.
I'm a little angry.
It has come to pass.
This doesn't scare me.
I feel somewhat sad.
I will master myself.
This cannot horrify me.
I must let grief pass me by.
I feel like a victor.
Who cares?
Arousing...
It's astonishing, really.
I'd like to get away from it.
Amusing.
That makes me angry.
I'm anguished.
I'm anxious.
This is agonizing.
I feel somewhat alienated.
That is amazing.
I'm ambivalent.
I can adore this.
That might be affection I feel.
This is agitating.
This is aggravating.
This makes me question it all.
I dislike this.
What has happened?
I am not pleased.
I feel some delight.
I feel despair.
This is disappointing.
That's disgusting.
This is confusing.
I feel only contempt.
I'm content.
I'm dejected.
It fills one with awe.
It makes me bitter.
It's boring.
I care.
That was frightening.
It's frustrating.
There's some glee here!
I'm a little gloomy.
That's exhilarating.
I burn with ferocity.
I feel fond.
I'm free.
I feel empathy.
I feel empty.
I enjoyed that.
That was exasperating.
This is distressing.
I'm eager to go.
I'm elated.
I'm embarrassed.
It's irritating.
I feel isolated.
It makes me jolly.
I feel jovial.
I cannot find hope.
This is humiliating.
I take offense.
It's interesting.
I feel guilty.
I'm happy.
I feel hate.
I have hope.
I'm glum.
I'm grateful.
I'm a little grouchy.
Harumph.
I feel passion.
It pleases me.
I'm proud.
My spirit moves.
I'm optimistic.
It is an outrage.
I feel a little panic.
I'm patient.
I feel miserable.
This is mortifying.
I'm nervous.
I feel nostalgia.
I feel jubilation.
I feel loathing.
I'm lonely.
I'm lustful.
I'm sympathetic.
I feel tenderness.
Thrilling.
I'm uneasy.

I repent of my deeds.
I feel resentful.
I feel restless.
I've been wronged.
I feel rejected.
I'm relieved.
I feel regret.
I feel remorse.
I'm excited.
Takes all kinds these days.
What is it this time...
That did not shock me.
Let's do this.
Things usually don't work out
I feel pretty good.
This is gaiety.
I am ready for this.
I'm beat.
It could happen!
I have my doubts.
I'm unhappy.
It's wondrous.
It's worrisome.
The wrath rises within me...
I laugh in the face of death!
I do not accept this.
There's not much to admire here.
I suppose I should be feel adoration.
I suppose this would be a joyous occasion.
There is no love.
I do not see the bliss in this.
There is no need to feel vengeful.
I guess it could be considered grimly satisfying.
This does not scare me.
I am not feeling sad right now.
That was not satisfying.
I am not upset by this.
Grief?  I feel nothing.
There is no need for celebration.
I have no feelings of rage.
If I thought about it more, I guess I'd be apathetic.
That is not in the least bit arousing.
Astonished?  No.
I'm not averse to it.
I'm not angry.
This is nothing.
No, that's not annoying.
I'm not anxious.
I guess that would be alienating.
That wasn't amazing.
I guess I should be feeling ambivalent right now.
That was not amusing.
I'm not feeling very affectionate.
I don't feel agitated.
I'm not feeling aggravated.
I can take this.
This won't make me lose faith.
I don't dislike that.
I'm not dismayed.
I feel no displeasure.
I am not filled with delight.
I will not despair.
I'm not disappointed.
It'll take more than that to disgust me.
This isn't confusing.
I don't feel contempt.
I am not contented.
There's nothing to be dejected about.
I am not held in awe.
That's nothing to be bitter about.
It isn't boring.
I don't care.
I guess that could have given me a fright.
This isn't frustrating.
I'm not gleeful.
I'm not feeling gloomy.
I am not exhilarated.
I should be feeling ferocious right now.
I am not fond of this.
I don't feel free.
I don't feel very empathetic.
What's inside me isn't emptiness exactly...
I'm not enjoying this.
This isn't exasperating.
This isn't distressing.
I am not eager.
I'm not elated.
This isn't embarrassing.
This isn't irritating.
I don't feel isolated.
I'm not jolly.
This doesn't put me in a jovial mood.
I will not lose hope.
No, this isn't humiliating.
That doesn't insult me.
No, I'm not interested.
I don't feel guilty about it.
I am not happy.
I feel no hatred.
I am not hopeful.
I don't feel glum.
I'm not feeling very grateful.
No, I'm not grouchy.
That doesn't make me grumpy.
I'm not feeling passionate.
I take no pleasure in this.
I am not proud.
This does not move me.
I'm not optimistic.
This doesn't outrage me.
I'm not panicking.
I am not feeling patient.
I'm not miserable.
I am not mortified.
I don't feel nervous.
I'm not feeling nostalgic.
This isn't the time for jubilation.
I am not filled with loathing.
I'm not lonely.
I am not burning with lust.
There will be no sympathy from me.
I don't feel tenderness.
There was no thrill in it.
I'm not uneasy.
I don't feel sorry for myself.
I bow to no one.
I can keep it together.
I have no shame.
I am not repentant.
I do not resent this.
I don't feel restless.
There's nothing to be indignant about.
I don't feel rejected.
I don't feel relieved.
I have no regrets.
I feel no remorse.
There is no gaiety.
This doesn't excite me.
placed
gave
I have no doubts.
I'm just not enthusiastic.
There's no reason to be pessimistic.
I should be feeling great.
I have no zeal for this.
I could be questioning my life right now.
This isn't a defeat.
I'm not expecting anything.
That doesn't make me unhappy.
There is no sense of wonder.
I'm not worried.
Wrath has not risen within me.

A force of evil has arisen in the world.
Something truly horrifying has vomited itself forth from the depths of the world.
A great monster from the underground is said to have emerged from the darkness.
Mastering the forces of nature would glorify us in the eyes of the world.
Demons from the underworld must not be permitted to walk freely upon the land.

It's such a noble pursuit.  Let's go immediately!
It would be so great to perform and make people happy.

I'd love to travel and create art.

The world generator is having trouble setting volcanism in the manner specified by the parameters.  
You must have at least as many of these highest volcanism points as you are requiring volcanos.  
You might want to check your preset volcanism for the value 100.  
Can volcanism be placed at the value 100 enough times to provide space for each of your volcanos?  
You might want to check your maximum volcanism value.  
The world generator is having trouble placing enough mid-level elevations.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of peaks required by the parameters.
You must have at least as many of these highest elevation points as you are requiring peaks.  
You might want to check your preset elevations for the elevation 400.  
The world generator is having trouble placing enough low elevations.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of mid-level elevation squares required.
You might want to adjust the parameters governing elevation frequencies.  
Can your parameters achieve elevations between 100 and 299?  
The world generator is having trouble placing enough ocean squares along the edges.  
Can your parameters achieve elevations between 300 and 400?

Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many mountain squares as you are requiring river start points.  
The world generator is having trouble placing rivers.  
Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, low-to-mid rainfall, high drainage, non-freezing areas.  
The world generator is having trouble placing hills.  
Alternatively, you can increase the number of subregions permitted by the parameters, up to the cap.
Make sure your parameters and presets aren't so variable that biomes change frequently.  
The world generator is placing too many subregions.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of rivers required by the parameters.
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of swamp squares and regions required by the parameters.
Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, mid-to-high rainfall, low drainage, non-freezing areas.  
The world generator is having trouble placing swamps and marshes.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of volcanos required by the parameters.

The world generator is having trouble placing low-lying caves.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of mountain caves required by the parameters.
Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many border mountain squares as you are requiring mountain caves.  
The world generator is having trouble placing mountain caves.  
Make sure your parameters and presets offer enough low-to-mid savagery, evil/good appropriate, biome appropriate squares to establish sites.  
The world generator is having trouble placing enough civilizations.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of non-mountain caves required by the parameters.
Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many mid-elevation squares as you are requiring low-lying caves.  
The world generator couldn't find any civilization definitions.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of civilizations required by the parameters.
If you have very few biome types and are placing good or evil regions, they'll often crowd out the civilizations as well.  
High savagery (66+) blocks civilization placement -- make sure your parameters and presets offer at least small pockets of low-to-mid savagery areas.  
Make sure your parameters and presets have adequate squares of this kind.  
Dwarves, for example, require non-evil, non-good, unsavage mountain squares that aren't surrounded by the ocean.  
The world generator is having trouble placing a controllable civilization.  
This problem cannot be resolved by continuing, so you should either abort or skip all rejects for a legends-only game.
