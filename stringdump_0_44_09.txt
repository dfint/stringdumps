Ignoring that I don't quite concur...  
Even if I don't change my mind,
you are so clever I must concede!
Although my own insignificant beliefs lie elsewhere,
You know, I think you're right.
I have been so foolish.  Yes, I agree.
Despite some minor reservations...  
Though I cannot agree fully on a slight technicality,
no one can deny your genius!
we can both agree you are by far the most persuasive!
I am so nearly swayed by your greatness alone that we can simply assign you the victory!
you needn't indulge my trivial thoughts!
I must say that is a truly insightful observation!
I admire how brilliant you are!
I am overmastered by your presence!
I confess your stunning argument overwhelms me!
  I will settle this my way.
You mock me?!
You insult me with your flattery
  This conversation is over.
You dare to flatter me?!
Base flattery!
Insufferable!
How dare you?!
How gracious!
Fine.  Let's drop the argument.
Let's move on.
You are right.
, but let us move on.
You insult me with your derision
Well, there must be something else to discuss.
If you insist so strongly, we can move on.
Eh?
Ha!
Ack!
Huh?
Let's drop the argument.
There must be something else to discuss.
No!
Yes, let's move on.
What?
Are you being serious?
What did you just say?
Wait, what?
How unreasonable!
Uh...
Give me a break.
Were you trying to make an argument?
That's absurd!
Oh, no,
don't waste my time with this drivel.
that is the stupidest statement I have ever heard.
Am I supposed to engage with that?
Forgive me, but
I've heard it all now!
You must be joking.
there's just no way you can believe something so stupid.
it would amaze me if somebody actually thought that.
you should keep your weird thoughts to yourself.
the things some people think just boggle the mind.
I couldn't follow your rambling.
really, I've been over all this nonsense before.
nobody could possibly believe that.
I'm having trouble taking you seriously.
Really.
Unbelievable.
I just don't know.
It's wrong.
I'm appalled.
that isn't at all convincing.
You're wrong.
Shameful.
That's wrong.
I cannot agree.
I beg to differ.
That's not right.
I don't know what to say.
I don't want to argue.
I disagree.
I guess I'm not sure.
Just think about it.
I don't agree.
No, I mean it.
I must insist.
Pause to consider.
No.
Stop and reflect.
You are thinking about this all wrong.
Help!  Save me!
I believe...  something.
Fool!
I must withdraw!
I require a substantive reply.
You must be convinced.
Well, I believe...  something else.
I sense you're wavering.

Rules are there to be bent, but they shouldn't be flouted thoughtlessly.
I consider laws to be more of a suggestion than anything.
You must never forget true loyalty.  Repay it in full.
How can society function without loyalty?  We must be able to have faith in each other.
Society flourishes when law breakers are punished.
Nothing gives them the right to establish these laws.
No law can do justice to the complexity of life.
Some laws are just, while others were made to be broken.

Family is complicated and those ties be both a boon and a curse.  Sometimes both at once!
You can't always rely on your family, but it's good to know somebody is there.
There's nothing like a good friend.
You can always rely on your family when everything else falls away.
Family is the true bond that keeps society thriving.
I was always irritated by family.
We cannot choose our families, but we can choose to avoid them.
Loyalty has value, but you should always keep the broader picture in mind.
You should only maintain loyalty so long as something more important is not at stake.
Consider your loyalties carefully, adhere to them while they last, and abandon them when you must.
How great it is to be surrounded by family!
One must always be loyal to their cause and the ones they serve.
Don't serve anyone blindly.  You'll only get into trouble.
The whole idea of loyalty is pointless.  Acting purely out of loyalty implies acting against one's own best interest.
Never lose yourself in loyalty.  You know what is best for yourself.
You should always tell the truth.
There is nothing so important that it is worth telling a lie.
Everything is so much easier when you just tell the truth.
There is no value in telling the truth thoughtlessly.  Consider the circumstances and say what is best.
You can be powerful or powerless.  The choice is yours, until somebody makes it for you.
There's nothing admirable about bullying others.
It is abhorrent to seek power over other people.
The struggle for power must be balanced by other considerations.
Building friendships is a waste.  There is no bond that can withstand distance or a change of circumstance.
Friends are nice, but you should keep your priorities straight.
Strive for power.
Power over others is the only true measure of worth.
Surround yourself with friends you can trust and you will be unstoppable.
When all other bonds wither, friendship will remain.
Be careful of your so-called friends.
Friends are future enemies.  I don't see the difference.  People do as they must.
There is a time for artful speech, and a time for blunt speech as well.
Always deal fairly.
Don't be afraid to do anything to get ahead in this world.
Life isn't fair, and sometimes you have to do what you have to do, but working toward a balance isn't a bad thing.
I do admire a clever turn of phrase.
I can appreciate the right turn of phrase.
Who are these mealy-mouthed cowards trying to impress?
They are so full of all those big words.
Sometimes the blunt truth just does more damage.  Think about how the situation will unfold before you speak.
I do admire a clever trap.
There's no value in all of this scheming I see these days.
Be shrewd, but do not lose yourself in guile.
Is there ever a time when honesty by itself overrides other considerations?  Say what is right, not what is true.
Don't think about the truth, whatever that is.  Just say what needs to be said.
There are times when it is alright not to tell the whole truth.
It is best not to complicate your life with lies, sure, but the truth also has its problems.
Art is complicated.  I know what I like, but some I can do without.
We should all work together.
It's better to work alone when possible, I think.  Cooperation breeds weakness.
You should think carefully before embarking on a joint enterprise, though there is some value in working together.
Art is life.
The creative impulse is so valuable.
What's so special about art?
Art?  More like wasted opportunity.
It's admirable when the traditions are upheld.
We need to find a better way than those of before.
We need to move beyond traditions.
Some traditions are worth keeping, but we should consider their overall value.
Please maintain your dignity.
What do you care how I speak or how I live?
I can see a place for maintaining decorum, but it's exhausting to live that way.
Some things should never change.
I think self-control is key.  Master yourself.
Why deny yourself your heart's desire?
People should be able to control themselves, but it's fine to follow impulses that aren't too harmful.
The mind thinks best when the world is at rest.
Knowledge can be useful, but it can also be pointless or even dangerous.
It is important to discover yourself.
Why would I waste time thinking about myself?
Some time spent in reflection is admirable, but you must not forget to live your life.
Do not hide yourself behind an unfeeling mask.
There are times when it is best to keep your feelings to yourself, but I wouldn't want to force it.
The quest for knowledge never ends.
All of that so-called knowledge doesn't mean a thing.
I treasure my freedom.
Nobody is free, and it is pointless to act as if you are.
Personal freedom must be tempered by other considerations.
One should not complain or betray any feeling.
A tool should get the job done, but one shouldn't obsess over the details.
A skilled warrior is a beautiful sight to behold.
Why this obsession with weapons and battle?  I don't understand some people.
The world isn't always safe.  I can see the value in martial training, the beauty even, but it shouldn't be exalted.
Merriment is worthless.
I can take or leave merrymaking myself, but I don't begrudge people their enjoyment.
An artisan, their materials and the tools to shape them!
Masterwork?  Why should I care?
Some discord is a healthy part of society, but we must also try to live together.
Be merry!
It's great when we all get a chance to be merry together.
Bah!  I hope you aren't celebrating something.
Give me the bustle and noise over all that quiet!
I like a balance of tranquility and commotion myself.
We should all be as one.  Why all the struggling?
We grow through debate and struggle, even chaos and discord.
An earnest effort at any required tasks.  That's all that's needed.
I only work so hard, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.
Hard work is great.  Finding a way to work half as hard is even better.
We must be ready to sacrifice when the time comes.
The best way to get what you want out of life is to work for it.
It's foolish to work hard for anything.
You shouldn't whittle your life away on working.
Hard work is bested by luck, connections and wealth every time.
I think people should hone their skills, but it's possible to take it too far and lose sight of the breadth of life.
There's more to life than becoming great at just one thing, but being good at several isn't bad!
In life, you should work hard.  Then work harder.
Hard work is the true sign of character.
We should all be so lucky as to truly master a skill.
The amount of practice that goes into mastering a skill is so impressive.
Everyone should broaden their horizons.  Any work beyond learning the basics is just a waste.
All of that practice is misspent effort.
There's some value in leisure, but one also has to engage with other aspects of life.
Trade is the life-blood of a thriving society.
All of this buying and selling isn't honest work.
There's something to be said for trade as a necessity, but there are better things in life to do with one's time.
Wouldn't it be grand to just take my life off and do nothing for the rest of my days?
It's best to slow down and just relax.
There's work to be done!
Time spent in leisure is such a waste.
There is value in a good rivalry, but such danger as well.
Keep going and never quit.
Anybody that sticks to something a moment longer than they have to is an idiot.
It's good to keep pushing forward, but sometimes you just have to know when it's time to stop.
Why harm yourself for anybody else's benefit?
Some self-sacrifice is worthy, but do not forget yourself in devotion to the well-being of others.
It's a competitive world, and you'd be a fool to think otherwise.
All of this striving against one another is so foolish.

War is sometimes necessary, but peace must be valued as well, when we can have it.
Uhh...

I could do without all of those creatures and that tangled greenery.
Nature can be enjoyed and used for myriad purposes, but there must always be respect and even fear of its power.
Let there be peace throughout the world.
How I long for the beautiful spectacle of war!
There's nothing like a great romance!
These people carrying on about romance should be more practical.
You shouldn't get too carried away with romance, but it's fine in moderation.
It's wonderful to be out exploring the wilds!
How can people be so glum?
I have trouble controlling my temper.
People can be so angry, and I just don't understand it.
W... worried?  Do I look worried?
I don't understand how somebody can become so obsessed by what somebody else has.
Be happy!
Is there something to be happy about?
It really gets me down sometimes.
People do get so carried away sometimes, but not I.
Sometimes I just don't like somebody.
How can someone be so consumed by hate?
I get so jealous sometimes.

It's a great day to fall in love all over again.
Why must they be so violent?
Get me going and I won't stop for anything.
Maybe I give up too early sometimes.
I don't always do things in the most efficient way.
So I overindulge sometimes.
Sometimes I think I need a drink, but I can control myself.
I am not governed by urges.
There's nothing like a good brawl.
I'm at my best under pressure.
Yes, I want more.  Is that so bad?
Why are they so fixated on these baubles?
I could really use a drink.
There's nothing to be upset about.
I'm feeling randy today!
I just don't understand these flames of passion people go on about.
I don't handle pressure well.
I don't think I'm cut out for this.
I look splendid today.
Some people are so wrapped up in themselves.
My goals are important to me.
I'm not much of a decision maker.
Have no fear.
Bravery is not a strength of mine.
We will be successful.
You don't care, so don't ask.
I try to live and behave properly.
What's this about proper living?
I was never one to follow advice.
We must be careful not to waste.
I don't mind stirring things up.
It's so great when everybody just gets along.
You're so perceptive!
Show some mercy now and again.
I'm concentrating on something.
Huh?  What was that?
I'm feeling optimistic about the future.
You shouldn't waste your life on revenge.
I am a very, very important person.
Oh, I'm nothing special.
There's no room for mercy in this world.
I wouldn't feel comfortable getting all dressed up.
Did you hear the one about the 
That isn't funny.
Don't get on my bad side.
I don't feel like I need to chase anything.
One should always return a favor.
It's not a gift if you expect something in return.
I like to dress well.
I don't understand why they have to be that way.
Friendship is forever.
I don't really get attached to people.
I go with the flow sometimes.
It's not perfect, but it's good enough.  Why fret about it?
I'm not going to change my mind.
Try to keep an open mind.
Everybody has their own way of life.
Who cares what they think?
I don't feel like telling you about it.
I could tell you all about it!
If you have a task, do it properly.
It won't turn out well.
I'm curious.  Tell me everything!
I don't really want to know.
I wonder what they think.
I prefer to be by myself.
People should listen to what I have to say.
I try not to interrupt.
There's so much to be done!
It's my mess.
People are basically trustworthy.
My trust is earned, and not by many.
It's such a joy to be with people.
I don't like being obligated to anybody.
Oh, I don't usually think much.
One must always carefully consider the correct course of action.
Everything just so in its proper place!
Don't bother trying to play on my emotions.
I'm happy to help.
Why should I help?
Do your duty.
I feel so tired of everything.
I can't take much more of this!
I feel angry all the time.
I'm feeling really worn down.
I cannot stand the world any longer...
Everything is all piling up at once!
I'm feel like I'm about to snap.
I just don't care anymore...
Try to focus on the practical side of the matter.
I encountered a fascinating conundrum recently.
A great piece of art is one that moves me.
I guess I just don't appreciate art.
What's the rush?
I need some more excitement in my life.
I'd just as soon not have anything too exciting happen today.
Do you have dreams?  Tell me a story!
just fine
I'm 
Somebody help!
Ah...  uh...
Everything's 
good
I've been

alright
It's all starting to get me down.
I've been feeling anxious.
I get fed up sometimes.
I've been under some pressure.
I can't believe how great I feel!
That's incredibly suspicious!
What's going on?!
What's that?!
Every last one of you will pay with your lives!
Ahhhhhhh!  No!
Eek!
What is the meaning of it all?!
How incredibly satisfying!
Oh joyous occasion!
The love overwhelms me!
Such sweet bliss!
The horror...
Rawr!!!
Waaaaa...
The pain!
I must press on!
I am in complete accord with this!
How admirable!
Such adoration I feel!
I am so happy!
I feel such love!
How blissful!
I will take revenge!
Yes!  It is done.
I must not succumb to fear!
I feel such unbearable sadness...
That was very satisfying!
The horror consumes me!
I cannot be overwhelmed by grief!
Fantastic!
I am so enraged!
I'm annoyed.
That's annoying.
So annoying!
I'm so anxious!
I am so angry!
The anguish is overwhelming...
How annoying!
It's annoying.
I feel so alienated...
Wow!  That's amazing!
I am so torn over this...
Ha ha!  So amusing!
How affectionate I am!
How agitating!
This is so aggravating!
The agony is too much!
How very delightful!
I despair at this!
My disappointment is palpable!
How disgusting!
I'm so incredibly confused...
I can't describe the contempt I feel...
I am so content about this.
I feel so dejected...
I'm awe-struck!
I'm terribly bitter about this...
This is so boring!
I care so much!
I could not care less.
I am very aroused!
Astonishing!
I really need to get away from this.
How exhilarating!
You will know my ferocity!
I'm feeling so fond!
Such freedom I feel!
I feel such empathy!
I feel so empty inside...
How enjoyable!
So exasperating!
What shall I do?  This is a disaster!
I can't wait to get to it!
Such elation I feel!
How embarrassing!
How naive I was...  this strikes me to the core.
I feel such an intense dislike...
Everything is coming apart!
I am very, very displeased.
There is no hope!
The humiliation!
Such an offense!
How incredibly interesting!
The guilt is almost unbearable!
Such happiness!
I am consumed by hatred.
I am filled with such hope!
How glum I am...
I am so grateful!
It makes me so grouchy!
Not that it's your business!  Harumph!
Such a fright!
How frustrating!
Glee!
The gloom blankets me...
My optimism is unshakeable!
This is such an outrage!
I'm panicking!  I'm panicking!
My patience is as the still waters.
Such misery!
The mortification overwhelms me!
I am so nervous!
Such nostalgia!
Such jubilation I feel!
I crawl with such unbearable loathing!
I'm so terribly lonely!
I'm overcome by lust!
How irritating!
I feel so isolated!
Such a jolly time!
How jovial I feel!
Why does it keep happening to me?  Why me?!
I live to serve...  my dear master...
I can't take it!
I am so ashamed!
I repent!  I repent!
I am overcome by such resentment...
I feel so restless!
I have been so wronged!
Such rejection!  I cannot stand it.
Such a relief!
I have so many regrets...
I feel such remorse!
I burn with such passion!
How pleasurable!
I am so proud!
Such total rapture!
I am wracked by doubts!
Let's go!
This cannot possibly end well...
I feel so good!
Nothing shall stand in my way!
What am I even doing here?
I feel so defeated...
I know it will come to pass!
Such unhappiness!
The wonder!
I'm so worried!
I am filled with such wrath!
I feel such sympathy!
The tenderness I feel!
It's so thrilling!
I feel so uneasy!
I am very satisfied.
This is a joyous time.
This is love.
How blissful I am.
I am about to lose it!
It is done.
Begone fear!
I cannot give in to sadness.
Most shocking!
This is truly horrifying.
I am almost overcome by grief.
This is great!
Such gaiety!
This is so exciting!
That's suspicious!
That's alarming!
That's very amusing.
I'm very angry.
I feel so anguished...
That's very annoying.
The agony I feel...
I feel alienated.
That's amazing!
I have strong feelings of ambivalence.
I adore this.
I'm feeling affectionate.
This is driving me to agitation.
I'm very aggravated.
I will have my revenge.
I am not scared!
I accept this.
I admire this.
I'm feeling very dejected.
This is delightful!
I feel such despair...
I am very disappointed.
I really care.
I'm so confused.
Contemptible!
I'm very content.
I'm very averse to this.
Awe-inspiring...
It makes me very bitter.
It's really boring.
It makes me very anxious.
It would be hard to care less.
I'm aroused!
It's quite astonishing.
I'm quite exasperated.
That was very exhilarating!
I'm feeling so ferocious!
I'm very fond.
This is so embarrassing...
I'm very empathetic.
I feel such emptiness.
I really enjoyed that!
This is quite displeasing.
I'm so distressed about this!
I'm very eager to get started.
I'm so elated.
So disgusting...
I've become so disillusioned.  What now?
I really don't like this.
It has all gone wrong!
I am very hopeful.
I feel hopeless.
This is so humiliating.
I am very insulted.
Harumph!
I feel so guilty.
I am so happy.
The hate burns within me.
It makes me so gloomy.
I feel so glum.
I'm very grateful.
It makes me very grouchy.
I feel so free.
That was so frightful.
This is very frustrating.
I'm so gleeful.
I'm feeling very nostalgic.
I'm quite optimistic.
This is an outrage!
I'm really starting to panic.
I feel such lust.
I'm so miserable.
I'm so mortified...
I'm very nervous.
I'm very jovial.
I feel much jubilation.
I feel so much loathing...
I'm very lonely.
It's very interesting.
I'm very irritated by this.
I feel very isolated.
I'm feeling so jolly.
I feel so wronged.
This is such a hardship for me!
I live to serve.
This leaves me so shaken.
I'm truly remorseful.
I must repent.
I'm very resentful.
I'm really restless.
I am so spiritually moved!
I feel so rejected.
I'm so relieved.
I'm so regretful.
I'm very patient.
I feel such passion.
I'm very pleased.
I am very proud.
Things are going to happen.
I'm very doubtful.
I feel enthusiastic!
I really don't see this working out.
I am wrathful.
I shall accomplish much!
What is the meaning of life...
I've been defeated.
I feel very uneasy.
I'm very unhappy.
I am filled with wonder.
I'm very worried.
I feel such shame.
I'm very sympathetic.
I feel such tenderness.
This is quite a thrill!
I feel somewhat sad.
That was satisfying.
This is nice.
Is this love?
I feel like a victor.
I'm a little angry.
It has come to pass.
This doesn't scare me.
That was alarming.
I will master myself.
This cannot horrify me.
I must let grief pass me by.
I'm feeling great!
The gaiety I'm feeling!
This is really exciting!
How suspicious...
I'm ambivalent.
Amusing.
That makes me angry.
I'm anguished.
This is aggravating.
This is agonizing.
I feel somewhat alienated.
That is amazing.
I find this somewhat admirable.
I can adore this.
That might be affection I feel.
This is agitating.
This could be bliss.
This might require an answer.
I feel no terror.
I can accept this.
I'm dejected.
I feel some delight.
I feel despair.
This is disappointing.
I care.
This is confusing.
I feel only contempt.
I'm content.
I'd like to get away from it.
It fills one with awe.
It makes me bitter.
It's boring.
I'm anxious.
Who cares?
Arousing...
It's astonishing, really.
That was exasperating.
That's exhilarating.
I burn with ferocity.
I feel fond.
I'm embarrassed.
I feel empathy.
I feel empty.
I enjoyed that.
I am not pleased.
This is distressing.
I'm eager to go.
I'm elated.
That's disgusting.
This makes me question it all.
I dislike this.
What has happened?
I have hope.
I cannot find hope.
This is humiliating.
I take offense.
Harumph.
I feel guilty.
I'm happy.
I feel hate.
I'm a little gloomy.
I'm glum.
I'm grateful.
I'm a little grouchy.
I'm free.
That was frightening.
It's frustrating.
There's some glee here!
I feel nostalgia.
I'm optimistic.
It is an outrage.
I feel a little panic.
I'm lustful.
I feel miserable.
This is mortifying.
I'm nervous.
I feel jovial.
I feel jubilation.
I feel loathing.
I'm lonely.
It's interesting.
It's irritating.
I feel isolated.
It makes me jolly.
I've been wronged.
Why me?
I will serve.
This has shaken me.
I feel remorse.
I repent of my deeds.
I feel resentful.
I feel restless.
My spirit moves.
I feel rejected.
I'm relieved.
I feel regret.
I'm patient.
I feel passion.
It pleases me.
I'm proud.
I have my doubts.
Let's do this.
Things usually don't work out
I feel pretty good.
The wrath rises within me...
I am ready for this.
I'm beat.
It could happen!
I'm uneasy.
I'm unhappy.
It's wondrous.
It's worrisome.
I am ashamed.
I'm sympathetic.
I feel tenderness.
Thrilling.
That was not satisfying.
I suppose this would be a joyous occasion.
There is no love.
I do not see the bliss in this.
I have no feelings of rage.
I guess it could be considered grimly satisfying.
This does not scare me.
I am not feeling sad right now.
That did not shock me.
I am not upset by this.
Grief?  I feel nothing.
There is no need for celebration.
This is gaiety.
I'm excited.
Takes all kinds these days.
What is it this time...
That was not amusing.
I'm not angry.
This is nothing.
No, that's not annoying.
I can take this.
I guess that would be alienating.
That wasn't amazing.
I guess I should be feeling ambivalent right now.
I suppose I should be feel adoration.
I'm not feeling very affectionate.
I don't feel agitated.
I'm not feeling aggravated.
There is no need to feel vengeful.
I laugh in the face of death!
I do not accept this.
There's not much to admire here.
There's nothing to be dejected about.
I am not filled with delight.
I will not despair.
I'm not disappointed.
I don't care.
This isn't confusing.
I don't feel contempt.
I am not contented.
I'm not averse to it.
I am not held in awe.
That's nothing to be bitter about.
It isn't boring.
I'm not anxious.
If I thought about it more, I guess I'd be apathetic.
That is not in the least bit arousing.
Astonished?  No.
This isn't exasperating.
I am not exhilarated.
I should be feeling ferocious right now.
I am not fond of this.
This isn't embarrassing.
I don't feel very empathetic.
What's inside me isn't emptiness exactly...
I'm not enjoying this.
I feel no displeasure.
This isn't distressing.
I am not eager.
I'm not elated.
It'll take more than that to disgust me.
This won't make me lose faith.
I don't dislike that.
I'm not dismayed.
I am not hopeful.
I will not lose hope.
No, this isn't humiliating.
That doesn't insult me.
That doesn't make me grumpy.
I don't feel guilty about it.
I am not happy.
I feel no hatred.
I'm not feeling gloomy.
I don't feel glum.
I'm not feeling very grateful.
No, I'm not grouchy.
I don't feel free.
I guess that could have given me a fright.
This isn't frustrating.
I'm not gleeful.
I'm not feeling nostalgic.
I'm not optimistic.
This doesn't outrage me.
I'm not panicking.
I am not burning with lust.
I'm not miserable.
I am not mortified.
I don't feel nervous.
This doesn't put me in a jovial mood.
This isn't the time for jubilation.
I am not filled with loathing.
I'm not lonely.
No, I'm not interested.
This isn't irritating.
I don't feel isolated.
I'm not jolly.
There's nothing to be indignant about.
I don't feel sorry for myself.
I bow to no one.
I can keep it together.
I feel no remorse.
I am not repentant.
I do not resent this.
I don't feel restless.
This does not move me.
I don't feel rejected.
I don't feel relieved.
I have no regrets.
I am not feeling patient.
I'm not feeling passionate.
I take no pleasure in this.
I am not proud.
I'm not expecting anything.
I have no doubts.
I'm just not enthusiastic.
There's no reason to be pessimistic.
Wrath has not risen within me.
I have no zeal for this.
I could be questioning my life right now.
This isn't a defeat.
I'm not uneasy.
That doesn't make me unhappy.
There is no sense of wonder.
I'm not worried.
I have no shame.
There will be no sympathy from me.
I don't feel tenderness.
There was no thrill in it.

You might want to check your maximum elevation value and other elevation parameters.  
The world generator is having trouble placing enough mountain peaks.  
Command Line: World generation manually aborted.
The world generator is having trouble placing enough mid-level elevations.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of peaks required by the parameters.
You must have at least as many of these highest elevation points as you are requiring peaks.  
You might want to check your preset elevations for the elevation 400.  
The world generator is having trouble placing enough low elevations.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of mid-level elevation squares required.
You might want to adjust the parameters governing elevation frequencies.  
Can your parameters achieve elevations between 100 and 299?  
The world generator is having trouble placing enough ocean squares along the edges.  
Can your parameters achieve elevations between 300 and 400?  
The world generator is having trouble placing enough high elevations.  
Can your parameters achieve elevations between 0 and 99?  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of ocean squares and regions required by the parameters.
Make sure your parameters and presets can support low elevation areas.  
The world generator is having trouble placing oceans.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of mountain squares and regions required by the parameters.
The world generator is having trouble placing tundra regions.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of glacial squares and regions required by the parameters.

Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, low-to-mid drainage, freezing areas.  
Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many mountain squares as you are requiring river start points.  
The world generator is having trouble placing rivers.  
Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, low-to-mid rainfall, high drainage, non-freezing areas.  
The world generator is having trouble placing hills.  
You must have at least as many of these highest volcanism points as you are requiring volcanos.  
You might want to check your preset volcanism for the value 100.  
Can volcanism be placed at the value 100 enough times to provide space for each of your volcanos?  
You might want to check your maximum volcanism value.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of swamp squares and regions required by the parameters.
Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, mid-to-high rainfall, low drainage, non-freezing areas.  
The world generator is having trouble placing swamps and marshes.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of volcanos required by the parameters.

Alternatively, you can reduce the number of forest squares and regions required by the parameters.
Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, high rainfall, high drainage, non-freezing areas.  
Make sure your parameters and presets have adequate squares of this kind.  
Dwarves, for example, require non-evil, non-good, unsavage mountain squares that aren't surrounded by the ocean.  
The world generator is having trouble placing a controllable civilization.  
This problem cannot be resolved by continuing, so you should either abort or skip all rejects for a legends-only game.  
Make sure your parameters and raw objects have adequate vegetation.  
Civilizations use available plants in their surroundings as their initial crops.  
The world generator is having trouble placing farming civilizations.  
Alternatively, you can remove the requirement of a controllable civilization from the parameters, which will restrict you to adventurers (assuming an appropriate civilization is placed).

Alternatively, you can increase the number of subregions permitted by the parameters, up to the cap.
Make sure your parameters and presets aren't so variable that biomes change frequently.  
The world generator is placing too many subregions.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of rivers required by the parameters.
The world generator is having trouble placing low-lying caves.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of mountain caves required by the parameters.
Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many border mountain squares as you are requiring mountain caves.  
The world generator is having trouble placing mountain caves.  
Make sure your parameters and presets offer enough low-to-mid savagery, evil/good appropriate, biome appropriate squares to establish sites.  
The world generator is having trouble placing enough civilizations.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of non-mountain caves required by the parameters.
Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many mid-elevation squares as you are requiring low-lying caves.  
The world generator couldn't find any civilization definitions.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of civilizations required by the parameters.
If you have very few biome types and are placing good or evil regions, they'll often crowd out the civilizations as well.  
High savagery (66+) blocks civilization placement -- make sure your parameters and presets offer at least small pockets of low-to-mid savagery areas.
