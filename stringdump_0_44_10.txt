You know, I think you're right.
I have been so foolish.  Yes, I agree.
Despite some minor reservations...  
Though I cannot agree fully on a slight technicality,
I am compelled to continue!
Over my dead body!
Yes, I can see it clearly now.
Maybe you're right.
I must say that is a truly insightful observation!
I admire how brilliant you are!
I am overmastered by your presence!
I confess your stunning argument overwhelms me!
Ignoring that I don't quite concur...  
Even if I don't change my mind,
you are so clever I must concede!
Although my own insignificant beliefs lie elsewhere,
You dare to flatter me?!
Base flattery!
Insufferable!
How dare you?!
no one can deny your genius!
we can both agree you are by far the most persuasive!
I am so nearly swayed by your greatness alone that we can simply assign you the victory!
you needn't indulge my trivial thoughts!
, but let us move on.
You insult me with your derision
Well, there must be something else to discuss.
If you insist so strongly, we can move on.
  I will settle this my way.
You mock me?!
You insult me with your flattery
  This conversation is over.
Let's drop the argument.
There must be something else to discuss.
No!
Yes, let's move on.
How gracious!
Fine.  Let's drop the argument.
Let's move on.
You are right.
How unreasonable!
Uh...
Give me a break.
Were you trying to make an argument?
Eh?
Ha!
Ack!
Huh?
Am I supposed to engage with that?
Forgive me, but
I've heard it all now!
You must be joking.
What?
Are you being serious?
What did you just say?
Wait, what?
I couldn't follow your rambling.
really, I've been over all this nonsense before.
nobody could possibly believe that.
I'm having trouble taking you seriously.
That's absurd!
Oh, no,
don't waste my time with this drivel.
that is the stupidest statement I have ever heard.
I'm appalled.
that isn't at all convincing.
You're wrong.
Shameful.
there's just no way you can believe something so stupid.
it would amaze me if somebody actually thought that.
you should keep your weird thoughts to yourself.
the things some people think just boggle the mind.
I don't know what to say.
I don't want to argue.
I disagree.
I guess I'm not sure.
Really.
Unbelievable.
I just don't know.
It's wrong.
Pause to consider.
No.
Stop and reflect.
You are thinking about this all wrong.
That's wrong.
I cannot agree.
I beg to differ.
That's not right.
I require a substantive reply.
You must be convinced.
Well, I believe...  something else.
I sense you're wavering.
Just think about it.
I don't agree.
No, I mean it.
I must insist.
What is this madness?  Calm yourself!
Help!  Save me!
I believe...  something.
Fool!
I must withdraw!

You must never forget true loyalty.  Repay it in full.
How can society function without loyalty?  We must be able to have faith in each other.
One must always be loyal to their cause and the ones they serve.
Don't serve anyone blindly.  You'll only get into trouble.
No law can do justice to the complexity of life.
Some laws are just, while others were made to be broken.
Rules are there to be bent, but they shouldn't be flouted thoughtlessly.

.  What happened to bring us to this?
 my neighbor.
You can't always rely on your family, but it's good to know somebody is there.
There's nothing like a good friend.
Surround yourself with friends you can trust and you will be unstoppable.
When all other bonds wither, friendship will remain.
I was always irritated by family.
We cannot choose our families, but we can choose to avoid them.
I hold the relationships I've forged myself over family ties I had no part in creating.
Family is complicated and those ties be both a boon and a curse.  Sometimes both at once!
Consider your loyalties carefully, adhere to them while they last, and abandon them when you must.
How great it is to be surrounded by family!
You can always rely on your family when everything else falls away.
Family is the true bond that keeps society thriving.
The whole idea of loyalty is pointless.  Acting purely out of loyalty implies acting against one's own best interest.
Never lose yourself in loyalty.  You know what is best for yourself.
Loyalty has value, but you should always keep the broader picture in mind.
You should only maintain loyalty so long as something more important is not at stake.
Everything is so much easier when you just tell the truth.
There is no value in telling the truth thoughtlessly.  Consider the circumstances and say what is best.
Is there ever a time when honesty by itself overrides other considerations?  Say what is right, not what is true.
Don't think about the truth, whatever that is.  Just say what needs to be said.
It is abhorrent to seek power over other people.
The struggle for power must be balanced by other considerations.
You should always tell the truth.
There is nothing so important that it is worth telling a lie.
Strive for power.
Power over others is the only true measure of worth.
You can be powerful or powerless.  The choice is yours, until somebody makes it for you.
There's nothing admirable about bullying others.
Be careful of your so-called friends.
Friends are future enemies.  I don't see the difference.  People do as they must.
Building friendships is a waste.  There is no bond that can withstand distance or a change of circumstance.
Friends are nice, but you should keep your priorities straight.
Don't be afraid to do anything to get ahead in this world.
Life isn't fair, and sometimes you have to do what you have to do, but working toward a balance isn't a bad thing.
Please maintain your dignity.
What do you care how I speak or how I live?
Who are these mealy-mouthed cowards trying to impress?
They are so full of all those big words.
There is a time for artful speech, and a time for blunt speech as well.
Always deal fairly.
There's no value in all of this scheming I see these days.
Be shrewd, but do not lose yourself in guile.
I do admire a clever turn of phrase.
I can appreciate the right turn of phrase.
There are times when it is alright not to tell the whole truth.
It is best not to complicate your life with lies, sure, but the truth also has its problems.
Sometimes the blunt truth just does more damage.  Think about how the situation will unfold before you speak.
I do admire a clever trap.
It's better to work alone when possible, I think.  Cooperation breeds weakness.
You should think carefully before embarking on a joint enterprise, though there is some value in working together.
I treasure my freedom.
Nobody is free, and it is pointless to act as if you are.
What's so special about art?
Art?  More like wasted opportunity.
Art is complicated.  I know what I like, but some I can do without.
We should all work together.
We need to move beyond traditions.
Some traditions are worth keeping, but we should consider their overall value.
Art is life.
The creative impulse is so valuable.
I can see a place for maintaining decorum, but it's exhausting to live that way.
Some things should never change.
It's admirable when the traditions are upheld.
We need to find a better way than those of before.
People should be able to control themselves, but it's fine to follow impulses that aren't too harmful.
The mind thinks best when the world is at rest.
Give me the bustle and noise over all that quiet!
I like a balance of tranquility and commotion myself.
Why would I waste time thinking about myself?
Some time spent in reflection is admirable, but you must not forget to live your life.
I think self-control is key.  Master yourself.
Why deny yourself your heart's desire?
The quest for knowledge never ends.
All of that so-called knowledge doesn't mean a thing.
Knowledge can be useful, but it can also be pointless or even dangerous.
It is important to discover yourself.
Personal freedom must be tempered by other considerations.
One should not complain or betray any feeling.
Do not hide yourself behind an unfeeling mask.
There are times when it is best to keep your feelings to yourself, but I wouldn't want to force it.
Why this obsession with weapons and battle?  I don't understand some people.
The world isn't always safe.  I can see the value in martial training, the beauty even, but it shouldn't be exalted.
We should all be so lucky as to truly master a skill.
The amount of practice that goes into mastering a skill is so impressive.
An artisan, their materials and the tools to shape them!
Masterwork?  Why should I care?
A tool should get the job done, but one shouldn't obsess over the details.
A skilled warrior is a beautiful sight to behold.
It's great when we all get a chance to be merry together.
Bah!  I hope you aren't celebrating something.
Merriment is worthless.
I can take or leave merrymaking myself, but I don't begrudge people their enjoyment.
We should all be as one.  Why all the struggling?
We grow through debate and struggle, even chaos and discord.
Some discord is a healthy part of society, but we must also try to live together.
Be merry!
Hard work is great.  Finding a way to work half as hard is even better.
We must be ready to sacrifice when the time comes.
Why harm yourself for anybody else's benefit?
Some self-sacrifice is worthy, but do not forget yourself in devotion to the well-being of others.
You shouldn't whittle your life away on working.
Hard work is bested by luck, connections and wealth every time.
An earnest effort at any required tasks.  That's all that's needed.
I only work so hard, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.
In life, you should work hard.  Then work harder.
Hard work is the true sign of character.
The best way to get what you want out of life is to work for it.
It's foolish to work hard for anything.
Everyone should broaden their horizons.  Any work beyond learning the basics is just a waste.
All of that practice is misspent effort.
I think people should hone their skills, but it's possible to take it too far and lose sight of the breadth of life.
There's more to life than becoming great at just one thing, but being good at several isn't bad!
All of this buying and selling isn't honest work.
There's something to be said for trade as a necessity, but there are better things in life to do with one's time.
There's nothing like a great romance!
These people carrying on about romance should be more practical.
There's work to be done!
Time spent in leisure is such a waste.
There's some value in leisure, but one also has to engage with other aspects of life.
Trade is the life-blood of a thriving society.
Anybody that sticks to something a moment longer than they have to is an idiot.
It's good to keep pushing forward, but sometimes you just have to know when it's time to stop.
Wouldn't it be grand to just take my life off and do nothing for the rest of my days?
It's best to slow down and just relax.
It's a competitive world, and you'd be a fool to think otherwise.
All of this striving against one another is so foolish.
There is value in a good rivalry, but such danger as well.
Keep going and never quit.
on 
the subject of 
the concept of 
the idea of 
I've
I have
 been 
considering
Let there be peace throughout the world.
How I long for the beautiful spectacle of war!
War is sometimes necessary, but peace must be valued as well, when we can have it.
Uhh...
You shouldn't get too carried away with romance, but it's fine in moderation.
It's wonderful to be out exploring the wilds!
I could do without all of those creatures and that tangled greenery.
Nature can be enjoyed and used for myriad purposes, but there must always be respect and even fear of its power.
People can be so angry, and I just don't understand it.
W... worried?  Do I look worried?
There's nothing to be upset about.
I'm feeling randy today!
Is there something to be happy about?
It really gets me down sometimes.
How can people be so glum?
I have trouble controlling my temper.
How can someone be so consumed by hate?
I get so jealous sometimes.
I don't understand how somebody can become so obsessed by what somebody else has.
Be happy!
the theme of 
It's a great day to fall in love all over again.
People do get so carried away sometimes, but not I.
Sometimes I just don't like somebody.
Maybe I give up too early sometimes.
I don't always do things in the most efficient way.
We must be careful not to waste.
I don't mind stirring things up.
I am not governed by urges.
There's nothing like a good brawl.
Why must they be so violent?
Get me going and I won't stop for anything.
Why are they so fixated on these baubles?
I could really use a drink.
So I overindulge sometimes.
Sometimes I think I need a drink, but I can control myself.
I just don't understand these flames of passion people go on about.
I don't handle pressure well.
I'm at my best under pressure.
Yes, I want more.  Is that so bad?
Some people are so wrapped up in themselves.
My goals are important to me.
I don't feel like I need to chase anything.
One should always return a favor.
Bravery is not a strength of mine.
We will be successful.
I don't think I'm cut out for this.
I look splendid today.
What's this about proper living?
I was never one to follow advice.
I'm not much of a decision maker.
Have no fear.
It's so great when everybody just gets along.
You're so perceptive!
You don't care, so don't ask.
I try to live and behave properly.
Huh?  What was that?
I'm feeling optimistic about the future.
It won't turn out well.
I'm curious.  Tell me everything!
Oh, I'm nothing special.
There's no room for mercy in this world.
Show some mercy now and again.
I'm concentrating on something.
That isn't funny.
Don't get on my bad side.
You shouldn't waste your life on revenge.
I am a very, very important person.
It's not a gift if you expect something in return.
I like to dress well.
I wouldn't feel comfortable getting all dressed up.
Did you hear the one about the 
I don't really get attached to people.
I go with the flow sometimes.
Don't bother trying to play on my emotions.
I'm happy to help.
Try to keep an open mind.
Everybody has their own way of life.
I don't understand why they have to be that way.
Friendship is forever.
I could tell you all about it!
If you have a task, do it properly.
It's not perfect, but it's good enough.  Why fret about it?
I'm not going to change my mind.
I don't really want to know.
I wonder what they think.
Who cares what they think?
I don't feel like telling you about it.
I try not to interrupt.
There's so much to be done!
What's the rush?
I need some more excitement in my life.
My trust is earned, and not by many.
It's such a joy to be with people.
I prefer to be by myself.
People should listen to what I have to say.
One must always carefully consider the correct course of action.
Everything just so in its proper place!
It's my mess.
People are basically trustworthy.
Why should I help?
Do your duty.
I don't like being obligated to anybody.
Oh, I don't usually think much.
I feel angry all the time.
I'm feeling really worn down.
It's all starting to get me down.
I've been feeling anxious.
I'm feel like I'm about to snap.
I just don't care anymore...
I feel so tired of everything.
I can't take much more of this!
A great piece of art is one that moves me.
I guess I just don't appreciate art.
I cannot stand the world any longer...
Everything is all piling up at once!
I'd just as soon not have anything too exciting happen today.
Do you have dreams?  Tell me a story!
Try to focus on the practical side of the matter.
I encountered a fascinating conundrum recently.
Somebody help!
Ah...  uh...
The horror...
Rawr!!!
I've been 
I feel 
just fine
I'm 
well
alright
Everything's 
good
I get fed up sometimes.
I've been under some pressure.
I'm doing 
fine
What's going on?!
What's that?!
The horror consumes me!
I cannot be overwhelmed by grief!
Eek!
What is the meaning of it all?!
I can't believe how great I feel!
That's incredibly suspicious!
The love overwhelms me!
Such sweet bliss!
Every last one of you will pay with your lives!
Ahhhhhhh!  No!
Waaaaa...
The pain!
How incredibly satisfying!
Oh joyous occasion!
How admirable!
Such adoration I feel!
How affectionate I am!
How agitating!
How blissful!
I will take revenge!
I must press on!
I am in complete accord with this!
I feel such unbearable sadness...
That was very satisfying!
I am so happy!
I feel such love!
Fantastic!
I am so enraged!
Yes!  It is done.
I must not succumb to fear!
So annoying!
I'm so anxious!
I could not care less.
I am very aroused!
How annoying!
It's annoying.
I'm annoyed.
That's annoying.
I am so torn over this...
Ha ha!  So amusing!
I am so angry!
The anguish is overwhelming...
This is so aggravating!
The agony is too much!
I feel so alienated...
Wow!  That's amazing!
My disappointment is palpable!
How disgusting!
How naive I was...  this strikes me to the core.
I feel such an intense dislike...
I am so content about this.
I feel so dejected...
How very delightful!
I despair at this!
This is so boring!
I care so much!
I'm so incredibly confused...
I can't describe the contempt I feel...
Astonishing!
I really need to get away from this.
I'm awe-struck!
I'm terribly bitter about this...
I'm feeling so fond!
Such freedom I feel!
Such a fright!
How frustrating!
How enjoyable!
So exasperating!
How exhilarating!
You will know my ferocity!
Such elation I feel!
How embarrassing!
I feel such empathy!
I feel so empty inside...
Everything is coming apart!
I am very, very displeased.
What shall I do?  This is a disaster!
I can't wait to get to it!
Such an offense!
How incredibly interesting!
How irritating!
I feel so isolated!
I am consumed by hatred.
I am filled with such hope!
There is no hope!
The humiliation!
It makes me so grouchy!
Not that it's your business!  Harumph!
The guilt is almost unbearable!
Such happiness!
Glee!
The gloom blankets me...
How glum I am...
I am so grateful!
I'm panicking!  I'm panicking!
My patience is as the still waters.
I burn with such passion!
How pleasurable!
I am so nervous!
Such nostalgia!
My optimism is unshakeable!
This is such an outrage!
I'm so terribly lonely!
I'm overcome by lust!
Such misery!
The mortification overwhelms me!
Such a jolly time!
How jovial I feel!
Such jubilation I feel!
I crawl with such unbearable loathing!
I can't take it!
I am so ashamed!
I feel such sympathy!
The tenderness I feel!
I feel so restless!
I have been so wronged!
Why does it keep happening to me?  Why me?!
I live to serve...  my dear master...
I have so many regrets...
I feel such remorse!
I repent!  I repent!
I am overcome by such resentment...
I am so proud!
Such total rapture!
Such rejection!  I cannot stand it.
Such a relief!
This cannot possibly end well...
I feel so good!
Such gaiety!
This is so exciting!
I feel so defeated...
I know it will come to pass!
I am wracked by doubts!
Let's go!
I'm so worried!
I am filled with such wrath!
Nothing shall stand in my way!
What am I even doing here?
It's so thrilling!
I feel so uneasy!
Such unhappiness!
The wonder!
This is love.
How blissful I am.
I will have my revenge.
I am not scared!
Begone fear!
I cannot give in to sadness.
I am very satisfied.
This is a joyous time.
I am almost overcome by grief.
This is great!
I am about to lose it!
It is done.
That's suspicious!
That's alarming!
Most shocking!
This is truly horrifying.
I feel so anguished...
That's very annoying.
It makes me very anxious.
It would be hard to care less.
That's amazing!
I have strong feelings of ambivalence.
That's very amusing.
I'm very angry.
This is driving me to agitation.
I'm very aggravated.
The agony I feel...
I feel alienated.
I accept this.
I admire this.
I adore this.
I'm feeling affectionate.
I feel such despair...
I am very disappointed.
So disgusting...
I've become so disillusioned.  What now?
Contemptible!
I'm very content.
I'm feeling very dejected.
This is delightful!
It makes me very bitter.
It's really boring.
I really care.
I'm so confused.
I'm aroused!
It's quite astonishing.
I'm very averse to this.
Awe-inspiring...
I'm feeling so ferocious!
I'm very fond.
I feel so free.
That was so frightful.
I feel such emptiness.
I really enjoyed that!
I'm quite exasperated.
That was very exhilarating!
I'm very eager to get started.
I'm so elated.
This is so embarrassing...
I'm very empathetic.
I really don't like this.
It has all gone wrong!
This is quite displeasing.
I'm so distressed about this!
This is so humiliating.
I am very insulted.
It's very interesting.
I'm very irritated by this.
I am so happy.
The hate burns within me.
I am very hopeful.
I feel hopeless.
I'm very grateful.
It makes me very grouchy.
Harumph!
I feel so guilty.
This is very frustrating.
I'm so gleeful.
It makes me so gloomy.
I feel so glum.
This is an outrage!
I'm really starting to panic.
I'm very patient.
I feel such passion.
I'm so mortified...
I'm very nervous.
I'm feeling very nostalgic.
I'm quite optimistic.
I feel so much loathing...
I'm very lonely.
I feel such lust.
I'm so miserable.
I feel very isolated.
I'm feeling so jolly.
I'm very jovial.
I feel much jubilation.
I live to serve.
This leaves me so shaken.
I feel such shame.
I'm very sympathetic.
I'm very resentful.
I'm really restless.
I feel so wronged.
This is such a hardship for me!
I'm so relieved.
I'm so regretful.
I'm truly remorseful.
I must repent.
I'm very pleased.
I am very proud.
I am so spiritually moved!
I feel so rejected.
I feel enthusiastic!
I really don't see this working out.
I'm feeling great!
The gaiety I'm feeling!
What is the meaning of life...
I've been defeated.
Things are going to happen.
I'm very doubtful.
I am filled with wonder.
I'm very worried.
I am wrathful.
I shall accomplish much!
I feel such tenderness.
This is quite a thrill!
I feel very uneasy.
I'm very unhappy.
This is nice.
Is this love?
This could be bliss.
This might require an answer.
It has come to pass.
This doesn't scare me.
I feel somewhat sad.
That was satisfying.
This cannot horrify me.
I must let grief pass me by.
I feel like a victor.
I'm a little angry.
This is really exciting!
How suspicious...
That was alarming.
I will master myself.
That makes me angry.
I'm anguished.
I'm anxious.
Who cares?
I feel somewhat alienated.
That is amazing.
I'm ambivalent.
Amusing.
That might be affection I feel.
This is agitating.
This is aggravating.
This is agonizing.
I feel no terror.
I can accept this.
I find this somewhat admirable.
I can adore this.
I feel despair.
This is disappointing.
That's disgusting.
This makes me question it all.
I feel only contempt.
I'm content.
I'm dejected.
I feel some delight.
It makes me bitter.
It's boring.
I care.
This is confusing.
Arousing...
It's astonishing, really.
I'd like to get away from it.
It fills one with awe.
I burn with ferocity.
I feel fond.
I'm free.
That was frightening.
I feel empty.
I enjoyed that.
That was exasperating.
That's exhilarating.
I'm eager to go.
I'm elated.
I'm embarrassed.
I feel empathy.
I dislike this.
What has happened?
I am not pleased.
This is distressing.
This is humiliating.
I take offense.
It's interesting.
It's irritating.
I'm happy.
I feel hate.
I have hope.
I cannot find hope.
I'm grateful.
I'm a little grouchy.
Harumph.
I feel guilty.
It's frustrating.
There's some glee here!
I'm a little gloomy.
I'm glum.
It is an outrage.
I feel a little panic.
I'm patient.
I feel passion.
This is mortifying.
I'm nervous.
I feel nostalgia.
I'm optimistic.
I feel loathing.
I'm lonely.
I'm lustful.
I feel miserable.
I feel isolated.
It makes me jolly.
I feel jovial.
I feel jubilation.
I will serve.
This has shaken me.
I am ashamed.
I'm sympathetic.
I feel resentful.
I feel restless.
I've been wronged.
Why me?
I'm relieved.
I feel regret.
I feel remorse.
I repent of my deeds.
It pleases me.
I'm proud.
My spirit moves.
I feel rejected.
Things usually don't work out
I feel pretty good.
This is gaiety.
I'm excited.
I'm beat.
It could happen!
I have my doubts.
Let's do this.
It's wondrous.
It's worrisome.
The wrath rises within me...
I am ready for this.
I feel tenderness.
Thrilling.
I'm uneasy.
I'm unhappy.
There is no love.
I do not see the bliss in this.
There is no need to feel vengeful.
I laugh in the face of death!
This does not scare me.
I am not feeling sad right now.
That was not satisfying.
I suppose this would be a joyous occasion.
Grief?  I feel nothing.
There is no need for celebration.
I have no feelings of rage.
I guess it could be considered grimly satisfying.
Takes all kinds these days.
What is it this time...
That did not shock me.
I am not upset by this.
This is nothing.
No, that's not annoying.
I'm not anxious.
If I thought about it more, I guess I'd be apathetic.
That wasn't amazing.
I guess I should be feeling ambivalent right now.
That was not amusing.
I'm not angry.
I don't feel agitated.
I'm not feeling aggravated.
I can take this.
I guess that would be alienating.
I do not accept this.
There's not much to admire here.
I suppose I should be feel adoration.
I'm not feeling very affectionate.
I will not despair.
I'm not disappointed.
It'll take more than that to disgust me.
This won't make me lose faith.
I don't feel contempt.
I am not contented.
There's nothing to be dejected about.
I am not filled with delight.
That's nothing to be bitter about.
It isn't boring.
I don't care.
This isn't confusing.
That is not in the least bit arousing.
Astonished?  No.
I'm not averse to it.
I am not held in awe.
I should be feeling ferocious right now.
I am not fond of this.
I don't feel free.
I guess that could have given me a fright.
What's inside me isn't emptiness exactly...
I'm not enjoying this.
This isn't exasperating.
I am not exhilarated.
I am not eager.
I'm not elated.
This isn't embarrassing.
I don't feel very empathetic.
I don't dislike that.
I'm not dismayed.
I feel no displeasure.
This isn't distressing.
No, this isn't humiliating.
That doesn't insult me.
No, I'm not interested.
This isn't irritating.
I am not happy.
I feel no hatred.
I am not hopeful.
I will not lose hope.
I'm not feeling very grateful.
No, I'm not grouchy.
That doesn't make me grumpy.
I don't feel guilty about it.
This isn't frustrating.
I'm not gleeful.
I'm not feeling gloomy.
I don't feel glum.
This doesn't outrage me.
I'm not panicking.
I am not feeling patient.
I'm not feeling passionate.
I am not mortified.
I don't feel nervous.
I'm not feeling nostalgic.
I'm not optimistic.
I am not filled with loathing.
I'm not lonely.
I am not burning with lust.
I'm not miserable.
I don't feel isolated.
I'm not jolly.
This doesn't put me in a jovial mood.
This isn't the time for jubilation.
I bow to no one.
I can keep it together.
I have no shame.
There will be no sympathy from me.
I do not resent this.
I don't feel restless.
There's nothing to be indignant about.
I don't feel sorry for myself.
I don't feel relieved.
I have no regrets.
I feel no remorse.
I am not repentant.
I take no pleasure in this.
I am not proud.
This does not move me.
I don't feel rejected.
I'm just not enthusiastic.
There's no reason to be pessimistic.
I should be feeling great.
There is no gaiety.
I could be questioning my life right now.
This isn't a defeat.
I'm not expecting anything.
I have no doubts.
There is no sense of wonder.
I'm not worried.
Wrath has not risen within me.
I have no zeal for this.
I don't feel tenderness.
There was no thrill in it.
I'm not uneasy.
That doesn't make me unhappy.

You might want to adjust the parameters governing savagery.  
Can volcanism be placed at the value 100 enough times to provide space for each of your volcanos?  
You might want to check your maximum volcanism value.  
The world generator is having trouble placing enough volcanos.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of high, medium or low volcanism squares required.
The world generator is having trouble placing swamps and marshes.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of volcanos required by the parameters.
You must have at least as many of these highest volcanism points as you are requiring volcanos.  
You might want to check your preset volcanism for the value 100.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of non-mountain caves required by the parameters.
Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many mid-elevation squares as you are requiring low-lying caves.  
The world generator is having trouble placing low-lying caves.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of mountain caves required by the parameters.
If you have very few biome types and are placing good or evil regions, they'll often crowd out the civilizations as well.  
High savagery (66+) blocks civilization placement -- make sure your parameters and presets offer at least small pockets of low-to-mid savagery areas.  
Make sure your parameters and presets offer enough low-to-mid savagery, evil/good appropriate, biome appropriate squares to establish sites.  
The world generator is having trouble placing enough civilizations.  
The world generator is having trouble placing a controllable civilization.  
This problem cannot be resolved by continuing, so you should either abort or skip all rejects for a legends-only game.  
The world generator couldn't find any civilization definitions.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of civilizations required by the parameters.
The world generator is having trouble placing farming civilizations.  
Alternatively, you can remove the requirement of a controllable civilization from the parameters, which will restrict you to adventurers (assuming an appropriate civilization is placed).
Make sure your parameters and presets have adequate squares of this kind.  
Dwarves, for example, require non-evil, non-good, unsavage mountain squares that aren't surrounded by the ocean.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of tundra squares and regions required by the parameters.
Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, low-to-mid drainage, freezing areas.

Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, low-to-mid rainfall, low-to-mid drainage, non-freezing areas.  
The world generator is having trouble placing grasslands.  
The world generator is placing too many subregions.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of rivers required by the parameters.
Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many mountain squares as you are requiring river start points.  
The world generator is having trouble placing rivers.  
Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many border mountain squares as you are requiring mountain caves.  
The world generator is having trouble placing mountain caves.  
Alternatively, you can increase the number of subregions permitted by the parameters, up to the cap.
