Okay!  I'll do it.
You first, coward!
Despite some minor reservations...  
Though I cannot agree fully on a slight technicality,
Ignoring that I don't quite concur...  
Even if I don't change my mind,
Yes, I can see it clearly now.
Maybe you're right.
You know, I think you're right.
I have been so foolish.  Yes, I agree.
I am overmastered by your presence!
I confess your stunning argument overwhelms me!
no one can deny your genius!
we can both agree you are by far the most persuasive!
you are so clever I must concede!
Although my own insignificant beliefs lie elsewhere,
I must say that is a truly insightful observation!
I admire how brilliant you are!
Insufferable!
How dare you?!
  I will settle this my way.
You mock me?!
I am so nearly swayed by your greatness alone that we can simply assign you the victory!
you needn't indulge my trivial thoughts!
You dare to flatter me?!
Base flattery!
Well, there must be something else to discuss.
If you insist so strongly, we can move on.
How gracious!
Fine.  Let's drop the argument.
You insult me with your flattery
  This conversation is over.
, but let us move on.
You insult me with your derision
No!
Yes, let's move on.
Eh?
Ha!
Let's move on.
You are right.
Let's drop the argument.
There must be something else to discuss.
Give me a break.
Were you trying to make an argument?
What?
Are you being serious?
Ack!
Huh?
How unreasonable!
Uh...
I've heard it all now!
You must be joking.
That's absurd!
Oh, no,
What did you just say?
Wait, what?
Am I supposed to engage with that?
Forgive me, but
nobody could possibly believe that.
I'm having trouble taking you seriously.
there's just no way you can believe something so stupid.
it would amaze me if somebody actually thought that.
don't waste my time with this drivel.
that is the stupidest statement I have ever heard.
I couldn't follow your rambling.
really, I've been over all this nonsense before.
You're wrong.
Shameful.
Really.
Unbelievable.
you should keep your weird thoughts to yourself.
the things some people think just boggle the mind.
I'm appalled.
that isn't at all convincing.
I disagree.
I guess I'm not sure.
That's wrong.
I cannot agree.
I just don't know.
It's wrong.
I don't know what to say.
I don't want to argue.
Stop and reflect.
You are thinking about this all wrong.
Just think about it.
I don't agree.
I beg to differ.
That's not right.
Pause to consider.
No.
Well, I believe...  something else.
I sense you're wavering.
Help!  Save me!
I believe...  something.
No, I mean it.
I must insist.
I require a substantive reply.
You must be convinced.
Fool!
I must withdraw!
What is this madness?  Calm yourself!

How can society function without loyalty?  We must be able to have faith in each other.
One must always be loyal to their cause and the ones they serve.
Don't serve anyone blindly.  You'll only get into trouble.
The whole idea of loyalty is pointless.  Acting purely out of loyalty implies acting against one's own best interest.
Some laws are just, while others were made to be broken.
Rules are there to be bent, but they shouldn't be flouted thoughtlessly.
I consider laws to be more of a suggestion than anything.
You must never forget true loyalty.  Repay it in full.
One should always respect the law.
Society flourishes when law breakers are punished.
Nothing gives them the right to establish these laws.
No law can do justice to the complexity of life.
a loyal soldier
.  What happened to bring us to this?
 my neighbor.
I don't know 
There's nothing like a good friend.
Surround yourself with friends you can trust and you will be unstoppable.
When all other bonds wither, friendship will remain.
Be careful of your so-called friends.
We cannot choose our families, but we can choose to avoid them.
I hold the relationships I've forged myself over family ties I had no part in creating.
Family is complicated and those ties be both a boon and a curse.  Sometimes both at once!
You can't always rely on your family, but it's good to know somebody is there.
How great it is to be surrounded by family!
You can always rely on your family when everything else falls away.
Family is the true bond that keeps society thriving.
I was always irritated by family.
Never lose yourself in loyalty.  You know what is best for yourself.
Loyalty has value, but you should always keep the broader picture in mind.
You should only maintain loyalty so long as something more important is not at stake.
Consider your loyalties carefully, adhere to them while they last, and abandon them when you must.
There is no value in telling the truth thoughtlessly.  Consider the circumstances and say what is best.
Is there ever a time when honesty by itself overrides other considerations?  Say what is right, not what is true.
Don't think about the truth, whatever that is.  Just say what needs to be said.
There are times when it is alright not to tell the whole truth.
The struggle for power must be balanced by other considerations.
You should always tell the truth.
There is nothing so important that it is worth telling a lie.
Everything is so much easier when you just tell the truth.
Power over others is the only true measure of worth.
You can be powerful or powerless.  The choice is yours, until somebody makes it for you.
There's nothing admirable about bullying others.
It is abhorrent to seek power over other people.
Friends are future enemies.  I don't see the difference.  People do as they must.
Building friendships is a waste.  There is no bond that can withstand distance or a change of circumstance.
Friends are nice, but you should keep your priorities straight.
Strive for power.
Life isn't fair, and sometimes you have to do what you have to do, but working toward a balance isn't a bad thing.
Please maintain your dignity.
What do you care how I speak or how I live?
I can see a place for maintaining decorum, but it's exhausting to live that way.
They are so full of all those big words.
There is a time for artful speech, and a time for blunt speech as well.
Always deal fairly.
Don't be afraid to do anything to get ahead in this world.
Be shrewd, but do not lose yourself in guile.
I do admire a clever turn of phrase.
I can appreciate the right turn of phrase.
Who are these mealy-mouthed cowards trying to impress?
It is best not to complicate your life with lies, sure, but the truth also has its problems.
Sometimes the blunt truth just does more damage.  Think about how the situation will unfold before you speak.
I do admire a clever trap.
There's no value in all of this scheming I see these days.
You should think carefully before embarking on a joint enterprise, though there is some value in working together.
I treasure my freedom.
Nobody is free, and it is pointless to act as if you are.
Personal freedom must be tempered by other considerations.
Art?  More like wasted opportunity.
Art is complicated.  I know what I like, but some I can do without.
We should all work together.
It's better to work alone when possible, I think.  Cooperation breeds weakness.
Some traditions are worth keeping, but we should consider their overall value.
Art is life.
The creative impulse is so valuable.
What's so special about art?
Some things should never change.
It's admirable when the traditions are upheld.
We need to find a better way than those of before.
We need to move beyond traditions.
The mind thinks best when the world is at rest.
Give me the bustle and noise over all that quiet!
I like a balance of tranquility and commotion myself.
We should all be as one.  Why all the struggling?
Some time spent in reflection is admirable, but you must not forget to live your life.
I think self-control is key.  Master yourself.
Why deny yourself your heart's desire?
People should be able to control themselves, but it's fine to follow impulses that aren't too harmful.
All of that so-called knowledge doesn't mean a thing.
Knowledge can be useful, but it can also be pointless or even dangerous.
It is important to discover yourself.
Why would I waste time thinking about myself?
One should not complain or betray any feeling.
Do not hide yourself behind an unfeeling mask.
There are times when it is best to keep your feelings to yourself, but I wouldn't want to force it.
The quest for knowledge never ends.
The world isn't always safe.  I can see the value in martial training, the beauty even, but it shouldn't be exalted.
We should all be so lucky as to truly master a skill.
The amount of practice that goes into mastering a skill is so impressive.
Everyone should broaden their horizons.  Any work beyond learning the basics is just a waste.
Masterwork?  Why should I care?
A tool should get the job done, but one shouldn't obsess over the details.
A skilled warrior is a beautiful sight to behold.
Why this obsession with weapons and battle?  I don't understand some people.
Bah!  I hope you aren't celebrating something.
Merriment is worthless.
I can take or leave merrymaking myself, but I don't begrudge people their enjoyment.
An artisan, their materials and the tools to shape them!
We grow through debate and struggle, even chaos and discord.
Some discord is a healthy part of society, but we must also try to live together.
Be merry!
It's great when we all get a chance to be merry together.
We must be ready to sacrifice when the time comes.
Why harm yourself for anybody else's benefit?
Some self-sacrifice is worthy, but do not forget yourself in devotion to the well-being of others.
It's a competitive world, and you'd be a fool to think otherwise.
Hard work is bested by luck, connections and wealth every time.
An earnest effort at any required tasks.  That's all that's needed.
I only work so hard, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.
Hard work is great.  Finding a way to work half as hard is even better.
Hard work is the true sign of character.
The best way to get what you want out of life is to work for it.
It's foolish to work hard for anything.
You shouldn't whittle your life away on working.
All of that practice is misspent effort.
I think people should hone their skills, but it's possible to take it too far and lose sight of the breadth of life.
There's more to life than becoming great at just one thing, but being good at several isn't bad!
In life, you should work hard.  Then work harder.
There's something to be said for trade as a necessity, but there are better things in life to do with one's time.
There's nothing like a great romance!
These people carrying on about romance should be more practical.
You shouldn't get too carried away with romance, but it's fine in moderation.
Time spent in leisure is such a waste.
There's some value in leisure, but one also has to engage with other aspects of life.
Trade is the life-blood of a thriving society.
All of this buying and selling isn't honest work.
It's good to keep pushing forward, but sometimes you just have to know when it's time to stop.
Wouldn't it be grand to just take my life off and do nothing for the rest of my days?
It's best to slow down and just relax.
There's work to be done!
All of this striving against one another is so foolish.
There is value in a good rivalry, but such danger as well.
Keep going and never quit.
Anybody that sticks to something a moment longer than they have to is an idiot.

It's wonderful to be out exploring the wilds!
I could do without all of those creatures and that tangled greenery.
Nature can be enjoyed and used for myriad purposes, but there must always be respect and even fear of its power.
Let there be peace throughout the world.
W... worried?  Do I look worried?
There's nothing to be upset about.
I'm feeling randy today!
I just don't understand these flames of passion people go on about.
It really gets me down sometimes.
How can people be so glum?
I have trouble controlling my temper.
People can be so angry, and I just don't understand it.
I get so jealous sometimes.
I don't understand how somebody can become so obsessed by what somebody else has.
Be happy!
Is there something to be happy about?
It's a great day to fall in love all over again.
People do get so carried away sometimes, but not I.
Sometimes I just don't like somebody.
How can someone be so consumed by hate?
I don't always do things in the most efficient way.
We must be careful not to waste.
I don't mind stirring things up.
It's so great when everybody just gets along.
There's nothing like a good brawl.
Why must they be so violent?
Get me going and I won't stop for anything.
Maybe I give up too early sometimes.
I could really use a drink.
So I overindulge sometimes.
Sometimes I think I need a drink, but I can control myself.
I am not governed by urges.
I don't handle pressure well.
I'm at my best under pressure.
Yes, I want more.  Is that so bad?
Why are they so fixated on these baubles?
My goals are important to me.
I don't feel like I need to chase anything.
One should always return a favor.
It's not a gift if you expect something in return.
We will be successful.
I don't think I'm cut out for this.
I look splendid today.
Some people are so wrapped up in themselves.
I was never one to follow advice.
I'm not much of a decision maker.
Have no fear.
Bravery is not a strength of mine.
You're so perceptive!
You don't care, so don't ask.
I try to live and behave properly.
What's this about proper living?
I'm feeling optimistic about the future.
It won't turn out well.
I'm curious.  Tell me everything!
I don't really want to know.
There's no room for mercy in this world.
Show some mercy now and again.
I'm concentrating on something.
Huh?  What was that?
Don't get on my bad side.
You shouldn't waste your life on revenge.
I am a very, very important person.
Oh, I'm nothing special.
I like to dress well.
I wouldn't feel comfortable getting all dressed up.
Did you hear the one about the 
That isn't funny.
I go with the flow sometimes.
Don't bother trying to play on my emotions.
I'm happy to help.
Why should I help?
Everybody has their own way of life.
I don't understand why they have to be that way.
Friendship is forever.
I don't really get attached to people.
If you have a task, do it properly.
It's not perfect, but it's good enough.  Why fret about it?
I'm not going to change my mind.
Try to keep an open mind.
I wonder what they think.
Who cares what they think?
I don't feel like telling you about it.
I could tell you all about it!
There's so much to be done!
What's the rush?
I need some more excitement in my life.
I'd just as soon not have anything too exciting happen today.
It's such a joy to be with people.
I prefer to be by myself.
People should listen to what I have to say.
I try not to interrupt.
Everything just so in its proper place!
It's my mess.
People are basically trustworthy.
My trust is earned, and not by many.
Do your duty.
I don't like being obligated to anybody.
Oh, I don't usually think much.
One must always carefully consider the correct course of action.
I'm feeling really worn down.
It's all starting to get me down.
I've been feeling anxious.
I get fed up sometimes.
I just don't care anymore...
I feel so tired of everything.
I can't take much more of this!
I feel angry all the time.
I guess I just don't appreciate art.
I cannot stand the world any longer...
Everything is all piling up at once!
I'm feel like I'm about to snap.
Do you have dreams?  Tell me a story!
Try to focus on the practical side of the matter.
I encountered a fascinating conundrum recently.
A great piece of art is one that moves me.
Ah...  uh...
The horror...
Rawr!!!
Waaaaa...
I feel 
just fine
I'm 
Somebody help!

I've been under some pressure.
I'm doing

What's that?!
The horror consumes me!
I cannot be overwhelmed by grief!
Fantastic!
What is the meaning of it all?!
I can't believe how great I feel!
That's incredibly suspicious!
What's going on?!
Such sweet bliss!
Every last one of you will pay with your lives!
Ahhhhhhh!  No!
Eek!
The pain!
How incredibly satisfying!
Oh joyous occasion!
The love overwhelms me!
Such adoration I feel!
How affectionate I am!
How agitating!
This is so aggravating!
I will take revenge!
I must press on!
I am in complete accord with this!
How admirable!
That was very satisfying!
I am so happy!
I feel such love!
How blissful!
I am so enraged!
Yes!  It is done.
I must not succumb to fear!
I feel such unbearable sadness...
I'm so anxious!
I could not care less.
I am very aroused!
Astonishing!
It's annoying.
I'm annoyed.
That's annoying.
So annoying!
Ha ha!  So amusing!
I am so angry!
The anguish is overwhelming...
How annoying!
The agony is too much!
I feel so alienated...
Wow!  That's amazing!
I am so torn over this...
How disgusting!
How naive I was...  this strikes me to the core.
I feel such an intense dislike...
Everything is coming apart!
I feel so dejected...
How very delightful!
I despair at this!
My disappointment is palpable!
I care so much!
I'm so incredibly confused...
I can't describe the contempt I feel...
I am so content about this.
I really need to get away from this.
I'm awe-struck!
I'm terribly bitter about this...
This is so boring!
Such freedom I feel!
Such a fright!
How frustrating!
Glee!
So exasperating!
How exhilarating!
You will know my ferocity!
I'm feeling so fond!
How embarrassing!
I feel such empathy!
I feel so empty inside...
How enjoyable!
I am very, very displeased.
What shall I do?  This is a disaster!
I can't wait to get to it!
Such elation I feel!
How incredibly interesting!
How irritating!
I feel so isolated!
Such a jolly time!
I am filled with such hope!
There is no hope!
The humiliation!
Such an offense!
Not that it's your business!  Harumph!
The guilt is almost unbearable!
Such happiness!
I am consumed by hatred.
The gloom blankets me...
How glum I am...
I am so grateful!
It makes me so grouchy!
My patience is as the still waters.
I burn with such passion!
How pleasurable!
I am so proud!
Such nostalgia!
My optimism is unshakeable!
This is such an outrage!
I'm panicking!  I'm panicking!
I'm overcome by lust!
Such misery!
The mortification overwhelms me!
I am so nervous!
How jovial I feel!
Such jubilation I feel!
I crawl with such unbearable loathing!
I'm so terribly lonely!
I am so ashamed!
I feel such sympathy!
The tenderness I feel!
It's so thrilling!
I have been so wronged!
Why does it keep happening to me?  Why me?!
I live to serve...  my dear master...
I can't take it!
I feel such remorse!
I repent!  I repent!
I am overcome by such resentment...
I feel so restless!
Such total rapture!
Such rejection!  I cannot stand it.
Such a relief!
I have so many regrets...
I feel so good!
Such gaiety!
This is so exciting!
That's suspicious!
I know it will come to pass!
I am wracked by doubts!
Let's go!
This cannot possibly end well...
I am filled with such wrath!
Nothing shall stand in my way!
What am I even doing here?
I feel so defeated...
I feel so uneasy!
Such unhappiness!
The wonder!
I'm so worried!
How blissful I am.
I will have my revenge.
I am not scared!
I accept this.
I cannot give in to sadness.
I am very satisfied.
This is a joyous time.
This is love.
This is great!
I am about to lose it!
It is done.
Begone fear!
That's alarming!
Most shocking!
This is truly horrifying.
I am almost overcome by grief.
That's very annoying.
It makes me very anxious.
It would be hard to care less.
I'm aroused!
I have strong feelings of ambivalence.
That's very amusing.
I'm very angry.
I feel so anguished...
I'm very aggravated.
The agony I feel...
I feel alienated.
That's amazing!
I admire this.
I adore this.
I'm feeling affectionate.
This is driving me to agitation.
I am very disappointed.
So disgusting...
I've become so disillusioned.  What now?
I really don't like this.
I'm very content.
I'm feeling very dejected.
This is delightful!
I feel such despair...
It's really boring.
I really care.
I'm so confused.
Contemptible!
It's quite astonishing.
I'm very averse to this.
Awe-inspiring...
It makes me very bitter.
I'm very fond.
I feel so free.
That was so frightful.
This is very frustrating.
I really enjoyed that!
I'm quite exasperated.
That was very exhilarating!
I'm feeling so ferocious!
I'm so elated.
This is so embarrassing...
I'm very empathetic.
I feel such emptiness.
It has all gone wrong!
This is quite displeasing.
I'm so distressed about this!
I'm very eager to get started.
I am very insulted.
It's very interesting.
I'm very irritated by this.
I feel very isolated.
The hate burns within me.
I am very hopeful.
I feel hopeless.
This is so humiliating.
It makes me very grouchy.
Harumph!
I feel so guilty.
I am so happy.
I'm so gleeful.
It makes me so gloomy.
I feel so glum.
I'm very grateful.
I'm really starting to panic.
I'm very patient.
I feel such passion.
I'm very pleased.
I'm very nervous.
I'm feeling very nostalgic.
I'm quite optimistic.
This is an outrage!
I'm very lonely.
I feel such lust.
I'm so miserable.
I'm so mortified...
I'm feeling so jolly.
I'm very jovial.
I feel much jubilation.
I feel so much loathing...
This leaves me so shaken.
I feel such shame.
I'm very sympathetic.
I feel such tenderness.
I'm really restless.
I feel so wronged.
This is such a hardship for me!
I live to serve.
I'm so regretful.
I'm truly remorseful.
I must repent.
I'm very resentful.
I am very proud.
I am so spiritually moved!
I feel so rejected.
I'm so relieved.
I really don't see this working out.
I'm feeling great!
The gaiety I'm feeling!
This is really exciting!
I've been defeated.
Things are going to happen.
I'm very doubtful.
I feel enthusiastic!
I'm very worried.
I am wrathful.
I shall accomplish much!
What is the meaning of life...
This is quite a thrill!
I feel very uneasy.
I'm very unhappy.
I am filled with wonder.
Is this love?
This could be bliss.
This might require an answer.
I feel no terror.
This doesn't scare me.
I feel somewhat sad.
That was satisfying.
This is nice.
I must let grief pass me by.
I feel like a victor.
I'm a little angry.
It has come to pass.
How suspicious...
That was alarming.
I will master myself.
This cannot horrify me.
I'm anguished.
I'm anxious.
Who cares?
Arousing...
That is amazing.
I'm ambivalent.
Amusing.
That makes me angry.
This is agitating.
This is aggravating.
This is agonizing.
I feel somewhat alienated.
I can accept this.
I find this somewhat admirable.
I can adore this.
That might be affection I feel.
This is disappointing.
That's disgusting.
This makes me question it all.
I dislike this.
I'm content.
I'm dejected.
I feel some delight.
I feel despair.
It's boring.
I care.
This is confusing.
I feel only contempt.
It's astonishing, really.
I'd like to get away from it.
It fills one with awe.
It makes me bitter.
I feel fond.
I'm free.
That was frightening.
It's frustrating.
I enjoyed that.
That was exasperating.
That's exhilarating.
I burn with ferocity.
I'm elated.
I'm embarrassed.
I feel empathy.
I feel empty.
What has happened?
I am not pleased.
This is distressing.
I'm eager to go.
I take offense.
It's interesting.
It's irritating.
I feel isolated.
I feel hate.
I have hope.
I cannot find hope.
This is humiliating.
I'm a little grouchy.
Harumph.
I feel guilty.
I'm happy.
There's some glee here!
I'm a little gloomy.
I'm glum.
I'm grateful.
I feel a little panic.
I'm patient.
I feel passion.
It pleases me.
I'm nervous.
I feel nostalgia.
I'm optimistic.
It is an outrage.
I'm lonely.
I'm lustful.
I feel miserable.
This is mortifying.
It makes me jolly.
I feel jovial.
I feel jubilation.
I feel loathing.
This has shaken me.
I am ashamed.
I'm sympathetic.
I feel tenderness.
I feel restless.
I've been wronged.
Why me?
I will serve.
I feel regret.
I feel remorse.
I repent of my deeds.
I feel resentful.
I'm proud.
My spirit moves.
I feel rejected.
I'm relieved.
I feel pretty good.
This is gaiety.
I'm excited.
Takes all kinds these days.
It could happen!
I have my doubts.
Let's do this.
Things usually don't work out
It's worrisome.
The wrath rises within me...
I am ready for this.
I'm beat.
Thrilling.
I'm uneasy.
I'm unhappy.
It's wondrous.
I do not see the bliss in this.
There is no need to feel vengeful.
I laugh in the face of death!
I do not accept this.
I am not feeling sad right now.
That was not satisfying.
I suppose this would be a joyous occasion.
There is no love.
There is no need for celebration.
I have no feelings of rage.
I guess it could be considered grimly satisfying.
This does not scare me.
What is it this time...
That did not shock me.
I am not upset by this.
Grief?  I feel nothing.
No, that's not annoying.
I'm not anxious.
If I thought about it more, I guess I'd be apathetic.
That is not in the least bit arousing.
I guess I should be feeling ambivalent right now.
That was not amusing.
I'm not angry.
This is nothing.
I'm not feeling aggravated.
I can take this.
I guess that would be alienating.
That wasn't amazing.
There's not much to admire here.
I suppose I should be feel adoration.
I'm not feeling very affectionate.
I don't feel agitated.
I'm not disappointed.
It'll take more than that to disgust me.
This won't make me lose faith.
I don't dislike that.
I am not contented.
There's nothing to be dejected about.
I am not filled with delight.
I will not despair.
It isn't boring.
I don't care.
This isn't confusing.
I don't feel contempt.
Astonished?  No.
I'm not averse to it.
I am not held in awe.
That's nothing to be bitter about.
I am not fond of this.
I don't feel free.
I guess that could have given me a fright.
This isn't frustrating.
I'm not enjoying this.
This isn't exasperating.
I am not exhilarated.
I should be feeling ferocious right now.
I'm not elated.
This isn't embarrassing.
I don't feel very empathetic.
What's inside me isn't emptiness exactly...
I'm not dismayed.
I feel no displeasure.
This isn't distressing.
I am not eager.
That doesn't insult me.
No, I'm not interested.
This isn't irritating.
I don't feel isolated.
I feel no hatred.
I am not hopeful.
I will not lose hope.
No, this isn't humiliating.
No, I'm not grouchy.
That doesn't make me grumpy.
I don't feel guilty about it.
I am not happy.
I'm not gleeful.
I'm not feeling gloomy.
I don't feel glum.
I'm not feeling very grateful.
I'm not panicking.
I am not feeling patient.
I'm not feeling passionate.
I take no pleasure in this.
I don't feel nervous.
I'm not feeling nostalgic.
I'm not optimistic.
This doesn't outrage me.
I'm not lonely.
I am not burning with lust.
I'm not miserable.
I am not mortified.
I'm not jolly.
This doesn't put me in a jovial mood.
This isn't the time for jubilation.
I am not filled with loathing.
I can keep it together.
I have no shame.
There will be no sympathy from me.
I don't feel tenderness.
I don't feel restless.
There's nothing to be indignant about.
I don't feel sorry for myself.
I bow to no one.
I have no regrets.
I feel no remorse.
I am not repentant.
I do not resent this.
I am not proud.
This does not move me.
I don't feel rejected.
I don't feel relieved.
There's no reason to be pessimistic.
I should be feeling great.
There is no gaiety.
This doesn't excite me.
This isn't a defeat.
I'm not expecting anything.
I have no doubts.
I'm just not enthusiastic.
I'm not worried.
Wrath has not risen within me.
I have no zeal for this.
I could be questioning my life right now.
There was no thrill in it.
I'm not uneasy.
That doesn't make me unhappy.
There is no sense of wonder.
