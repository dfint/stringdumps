You mock me?!
Insufferable!
you needn't indulge my trivial thoughts!
no one can deny your genius!
Base flattery!
I am so nearly swayed by your greatness alone that we can simply assign you the victory!
If you insist so strongly, we can move on.
, but let us move on.
Fine.  Let's drop the argument.
Well, there must be something else to discuss.
  This conversation is over.
  I will settle this my way.
You insult me with your derision
You insult me with your flattery
Yes, let's move on.
Let's drop the argument.
Ha!
No!
You are right.
How gracious!
There must be something else to discuss.
Let's move on.
Were you trying to make an argument?
How unreasonable!
Are you being serious?
Give me a break.
Huh?
Eh?
Uh...
Ack!
You must be joking.
Am I supposed to engage with that?
Oh, no,
I've heard it all now!
Wait, what?
What?
Forgive me, but
What did you just say?
I'm having trouble taking you seriously.
I couldn't follow your rambling.
it would amaze me if somebody actually thought that.
nobody could possibly believe that.
that is the stupidest statement I have ever heard.
That's absurd!
really, I've been over all this nonsense before.
don't waste my time with this drivel.
Shameful.
I'm appalled.
Unbelievable.
You're wrong.
the things some people think just boggle the mind.
there's just no way you can believe something so stupid.
that isn't at all convincing.
you should keep your weird thoughts to yourself.
I guess I'm not sure.
I don't know what to say.
I cannot agree.
I disagree.
It's wrong.
Really.
I don't want to argue.
I just don't know.
You are thinking about this all wrong.
Pause to consider.
I don't agree.
Stop and reflect.
That's not right.
That's wrong.
No.
I beg to differ.
I sense you're wavering.
I require a substantive reply.
I believe...  something.
Well, I believe...  something else.
I must insist.
Just think about it.
You must be convinced.
No, I mean it.
I must withdraw!
Help!  Save me!
What is this madness?  Calm yourself!
Fool!

You must never forget true loyalty.  Repay it in full.
How can society function without loyalty?  We must be able to have faith in each other.
One must always be loyal to their cause and the ones they serve.
Don't serve anyone blindly.  You'll only get into trouble.
No law can do justice to the complexity of life.
Some laws are just, while others were made to be broken.
Rules are there to be bent, but they shouldn't be flouted thoughtlessly.
I consider laws to be more of a suggestion than anything.
I don't know 
One should always respect the law.
Society flourishes when law breakers are punished.
Nothing gives them the right to establish these laws.

a loyal soldier
.  What happened to bring us to this?
 my neighbor.
You can't always rely on your family, but it's good to know somebody is there.
There's nothing like a good friend.
Surround yourself with friends you can trust and you will be unstoppable.
When all other bonds wither, friendship will remain.
I was always irritated by family.
We cannot choose our families, but we can choose to avoid them.
I hold the relationships I've forged myself over family ties I had no part in creating.
Family is complicated and those ties be both a boon and a curse.  Sometimes both at once!
Consider your loyalties carefully, adhere to them while they last, and abandon them when you must.
How great it is to be surrounded by family!
You can always rely on your family when everything else falls away.
Family is the true bond that keeps society thriving.
The whole idea of loyalty is pointless.  Acting purely out of loyalty implies acting against one's own best interest.
Never lose yourself in loyalty.  You know what is best for yourself.
Loyalty has value, but you should always keep the broader picture in mind.
You should only maintain loyalty so long as something more important is not at stake.
Everything is so much easier when you just tell the truth.
There is no value in telling the truth thoughtlessly.  Consider the circumstances and say what is best.
Is there ever a time when honesty by itself overrides other considerations?  Say what is right, not what is true.
Don't think about the truth, whatever that is.  Just say what needs to be said.
It is abhorrent to seek power over other people.
The struggle for power must be balanced by other considerations.
You should always tell the truth.
There is nothing so important that it is worth telling a lie.
Strive for power.
Power over others is the only true measure of worth.
You can be powerful or powerless.  The choice is yours, until somebody makes it for you.
There's nothing admirable about bullying others.
Be careful of your so-called friends.
Friends are future enemies.  I don't see the difference.  People do as they must.
Building friendships is a waste.  There is no bond that can withstand distance or a change of circumstance.
Friends are nice, but you should keep your priorities straight.
Don't be afraid to do anything to get ahead in this world.
Life isn't fair, and sometimes you have to do what you have to do, but working toward a balance isn't a bad thing.
Please maintain your dignity.
What do you care how I speak or how I live?
Who are these mealy-mouthed cowards trying to impress?
They are so full of all those big words.
There is a time for artful speech, and a time for blunt speech as well.
Always deal fairly.
There's no value in all of this scheming I see these days.
Be shrewd, but do not lose yourself in guile.
I do admire a clever turn of phrase.
I can appreciate the right turn of phrase.
There are times when it is alright not to tell the whole truth.
It is best not to complicate your life with lies, sure, but the truth also has its problems.
Sometimes the blunt truth just does more damage.  Think about how the situation will unfold before you speak.
I do admire a clever trap.
It's better to work alone when possible, I think.  Cooperation breeds weakness.
You should think carefully before embarking on a joint enterprise, though there is some value in working together.
I treasure my freedom.
Nobody is free, and it is pointless to act as if you are.
What's so special about art?
Art?  More like wasted opportunity.
Art is complicated.  I know what I like, but some I can do without.
We should all work together.
We need to move beyond traditions.
Some traditions are worth keeping, but we should consider their overall value.
Art is life.
The creative impulse is so valuable.
I can see a place for maintaining decorum, but it's exhausting to live that way.
Some things should never change.
It's admirable when the traditions are upheld.
We need to find a better way than those of before.
People should be able to control themselves, but it's fine to follow impulses that aren't too harmful.
The mind thinks best when the world is at rest.
Give me the bustle and noise over all that quiet!
I like a balance of tranquility and commotion myself.
Why would I waste time thinking about myself?
Some time spent in reflection is admirable, but you must not forget to live your life.
I think self-control is key.  Master yourself.
Why deny yourself your heart's desire?
The quest for knowledge never ends.
All of that so-called knowledge doesn't mean a thing.
Knowledge can be useful, but it can also be pointless or even dangerous.
It is important to discover yourself.
Personal freedom must be tempered by other considerations.
One should not complain or betray any feeling.
Do not hide yourself behind an unfeeling mask.
There are times when it is best to keep your feelings to yourself, but I wouldn't want to force it.
Why this obsession with weapons and battle?  I don't understand some people.
The world isn't always safe.  I can see the value in martial training, the beauty even, but it shouldn't be exalted.
We should all be so lucky as to truly master a skill.
The amount of practice that goes into mastering a skill is so impressive.
An artisan, their materials and the tools to shape them!
Masterwork?  Why should I care?
A tool should get the job done, but one shouldn't obsess over the details.
A skilled warrior is a beautiful sight to behold.
It's great when we all get a chance to be merry together.
Bah!  I hope you aren't celebrating something.
Merriment is worthless.
I can take or leave merrymaking myself, but I don't begrudge people their enjoyment.
We should all be as one.  Why all the struggling?
We grow through debate and struggle, even chaos and discord.
Some discord is a healthy part of society, but we must also try to live together.
Be merry!
Hard work is great.  Finding a way to work half as hard is even better.
We must be ready to sacrifice when the time comes.
Why harm yourself for anybody else's benefit?
Some self-sacrifice is worthy, but do not forget yourself in devotion to the well-being of others.
You shouldn't whittle your life away on working.
Hard work is bested by luck, connections and wealth every time.
An earnest effort at any required tasks.  That's all that's needed.
I only work so hard, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.
In life, you should work hard.  Then work harder.
Hard work is the true sign of character.
The best way to get what you want out of life is to work for it.
It's foolish to work hard for anything.
Everyone should broaden their horizons.  Any work beyond learning the basics is just a waste.
All of that practice is misspent effort.
I think people should hone their skills, but it's possible to take it too far and lose sight of the breadth of life.
There's more to life than becoming great at just one thing, but being good at several isn't bad!
All of this buying and selling isn't honest work.
There's something to be said for trade as a necessity, but there are better things in life to do with one's time.
There's nothing like a great romance!
These people carrying on about romance should be more practical.
There's work to be done!
Time spent in leisure is such a waste.
There's some value in leisure, but one also has to engage with other aspects of life.
Trade is the life-blood of a thriving society.
Anybody that sticks to something a moment longer than they have to is an idiot.
It's good to keep pushing forward, but sometimes you just have to know when it's time to stop.
Wouldn't it be grand to just take my life off and do nothing for the rest of my days?
It's best to slow down and just relax.
It's a competitive world, and you'd be a fool to think otherwise.
All of this striving against one another is so foolish.
There is value in a good rivalry, but such danger as well.
Keep going and never quit.

considering
Let there be peace throughout the world.
How I long for the beautiful spectacle of war!
War is sometimes necessary, but peace must be valued as well, when we can have it.
Uhh...
You shouldn't get too carried away with romance, but it's fine in moderation.
It's wonderful to be out exploring the wilds!
I could do without all of those creatures and that tangled greenery.
Nature can be enjoyed and used for myriad purposes, but there must always be respect and even fear of its power.
People can be so angry, and I just don't understand it.
W... worried?  Do I look worried?
There's nothing to be upset about.
I'm feeling randy today!
Is there something to be happy about?
It really gets me down sometimes.
How can people be so glum?
I have trouble controlling my temper.
How can someone be so consumed by hate?
I get so jealous sometimes.
I don't understand how somebody can become so obsessed by what somebody else has.
Be happy!
the theme of 
It's a great day to fall in love all over again.
People do get so carried away sometimes, but not I.
Sometimes I just don't like somebody.
Maybe I give up too early sometimes.
I don't always do things in the most efficient way.
We must be careful not to waste.
I don't mind stirring things up.
I am not governed by urges.
There's nothing like a good brawl.
Why must they be so violent?
Get me going and I won't stop for anything.
Why are they so fixated on these baubles?
I could really use a drink.
So I overindulge sometimes.
Sometimes I think I need a drink, but I can control myself.
I just don't understand these flames of passion people go on about.
I don't handle pressure well.
I'm at my best under pressure.
Yes, I want more.  Is that so bad?
Some people are so wrapped up in themselves.
My goals are important to me.
I don't feel like I need to chase anything.
One should always return a favor.
Bravery is not a strength of mine.
We will be successful.
I don't think I'm cut out for this.
I look splendid today.
What's this about proper living?
I was never one to follow advice.
I'm not much of a decision maker.
Have no fear.
It's so great when everybody just gets along.
You're so perceptive!
You don't care, so don't ask.
I try to live and behave properly.
Huh?  What was that?
I'm feeling optimistic about the future.
It won't turn out well.
I'm curious.  Tell me everything!
Oh, I'm nothing special.
There's no room for mercy in this world.
Show some mercy now and again.
I'm concentrating on something.
That isn't funny.
Don't get on my bad side.
You shouldn't waste your life on revenge.
I am a very, very important person.
It's not a gift if you expect something in return.
I like to dress well.
I wouldn't feel comfortable getting all dressed up.
Did you hear the one about the 
I don't really get attached to people.
I go with the flow sometimes.
Don't bother trying to play on my emotions.
I'm happy to help.
Try to keep an open mind.
Everybody has their own way of life.
I don't understand why they have to be that way.
Friendship is forever.
I could tell you all about it!
If you have a task, do it properly.
It's not perfect, but it's good enough.  Why fret about it?
I'm not going to change my mind.
I don't really want to know.
I wonder what they think.
Who cares what they think?
I don't feel like telling you about it.
I try not to interrupt.
There's so much to be done!
What's the rush?
I need some more excitement in my life.
My trust is earned, and not by many.
It's such a joy to be with people.
I prefer to be by myself.
People should listen to what I have to say.
One must always carefully consider the correct course of action.
Everything just so in its proper place!
It's my mess.
People are basically trustworthy.
Why should I help?
Do your duty.
I don't like being obligated to anybody.
Oh, I don't usually think much.
I feel angry all the time.
I'm feeling really worn down.
It's all starting to get me down.
I've been feeling anxious.
I'm feel like I'm about to snap.
I just don't care anymore...
I feel so tired of everything.
I can't take much more of this!
A great piece of art is one that moves me.
I guess I just don't appreciate art.
I cannot stand the world any longer...
Everything is all piling up at once!
I'd just as soon not have anything too exciting happen today.
Do you have dreams?  Tell me a story!
Try to focus on the practical side of the matter.
I encountered a fascinating conundrum recently.
Somebody help!
Ah...  uh...
The horror...
Rawr!!!
I've been

I'm

Everything's

I get fed up sometimes.
I've been under some pressure.
I'm doing 
fine
What's going on?!
What's that?!
The horror consumes me!
I cannot be overwhelmed by grief!
Eek!
What is the meaning of it all?!
I can't believe how great I feel!
That's incredibly suspicious!
The love overwhelms me!
Such sweet bliss!
Every last one of you will pay with your lives!
Ahhhhhhh!  No!
Waaaaa...
The pain!
How incredibly satisfying!
Oh joyous occasion!
How admirable!
Such adoration I feel!
How affectionate I am!
How agitating!

I will take revenge!

Fantastic!

Yes!  It is done.
I must not succumb to fear!
So annoying!
I'm so anxious!
I could not care less.
I am very aroused!
How annoying!
It's annoying.
I'm annoyed.
That's annoying.
I am so torn over this...
Ha ha!  So amusing!

The anguish is overwhelming...
This is so aggravating!
The agony is too much!

How very delightful!
I despair at this!
This is so boring!

I can't describe the contempt I feel...
Astonishing!
I really need to get away from this.
I'm awe-struck!
I'm terribly bitter about this...
I'm feeling so fond!
Such freedom I feel!
Such a fright!
How frustrating!
How enjoyable!
So exasperating!
How exhilarating!
You will know my ferocity!
Such elation I feel!
How embarrassing!
I feel such empathy!
I feel so empty inside...
Everything is coming apart!
I am very, very displeased.
What shall I do?  This is a disaster!
I can't wait to get to it!
Such an offense!
How incredibly interesting!
How irritating!
I feel so isolated!
I am consumed by hatred.
I am filled with such hope!
There is no hope!
The humiliation!
It makes me so grouchy!
Not that it's your business!  Harumph!
The guilt is almost unbearable!
Such happiness!
Glee!
The gloom blankets me...
How glum I am...
I am so grateful!
I'm panicking!  I'm panicking!
My patience is as the still waters.
I burn with such passion!
How pleasurable!
I am so nervous!
Such nostalgia!

This is such an outrage!
I'm so terribly lonely!
I'm overcome by lust!

Such jubilation I feel!
I crawl with such unbearable loathing!
I can't take it!
I am so ashamed!
I feel such sympathy!
The tenderness I feel!
I feel so restless!

Why does it keep happening to me?  Why me?!
I live to serve...  my dear master...
I have so many regrets...
I feel such remorse!
I repent!  I repent!
I am overcome by such resentment...
I am so proud!
Such total rapture!
Such rejection!  I cannot stand it.
Such a relief!
This cannot possibly end well...
I feel so good!
Such gaiety!
This is so exciting!
I feel so defeated...
I know it will come to pass!
I am wracked by doubts!
Let's go!
I'm so worried!
I am filled with such wrath!
Nothing shall stand in my way!
What am I even doing here?
It's so thrilling!
I feel so uneasy!
Such unhappiness!
The wonder!
This is love.
How blissful I am.
I will have my revenge.
I am not scared!
Begone fear!
I cannot give in to sadness.
I am very satisfied.
This is a joyous time.
I am almost overcome by grief.
This is great!
I am about to lose it!
It is done.
That's suspicious!
That's alarming!
Most shocking!
This is truly horrifying.
I feel so anguished...
That's very annoying.
It makes me very anxious.
It would be hard to care less.
That's amazing!

I am filled with wonder.
I'm very worried.
I am wrathful.
I shall accomplish much!
I feel such tenderness.
This is quite a thrill!
I feel very uneasy.
I'm very unhappy.
This is nice.
Is this love?
This could be bliss.
This might require an answer.
It has come to pass.
This doesn't scare me.
I feel somewhat sad.
That was satisfying.
This cannot horrify me.
I must let grief pass me by.
I feel like a victor.
I'm a little angry.
This is really exciting!
How suspicious...
That was alarming.
I will master myself.
That makes me angry.
I'm anguished.

Let's do this.
It's wondrous.
It's worrisome.
The wrath rises within me...
I am ready for this.
I feel tenderness.
Thrilling.
I'm uneasy.
I'm unhappy.
There is no love.
I do not see the bliss in this.
There is no need to feel vengeful.
I laugh in the face of death!
This does not scare me.
I am not feeling sad right now.
That was not satisfying.
I suppose this would be a joyous occasion.
Grief?  I feel nothing.
There is no need for celebration.
I have no feelings of rage.
I guess it could be considered grimly satisfying.
Takes all kinds these days.
What is it this time...
That did not shock me.
I am not upset by this.
This is nothing.
No, that's not annoying.

Astonished?  No.
I'm not averse to it.
I am not held in awe.
I should be feeling ferocious right now.
I am not fond of this.

There's no reason to be pessimistic.

There is no gaiety.
I could be questioning my life right now.
This isn't a defeat.
I'm not expecting anything.
I have no doubts.
There is no sense of wonder.
I'm not worried.
Wrath has not risen within me.
I have no zeal for this.
I don't feel tenderness.

I've been out in the sunshine again after a long time away.

I was out in a blizzard.
It was snowing on me.
I got caught in a miasma.
I was caught in smoke underground.
I was out in the rain.

Alternatively, you can reduce the number of civilizations required by the parameters.
If you have very few biome types and are placing good or evil regions, they'll often crowd out the civilizations as well.  
High savagery (66+) blocks civilization placement -- make sure your parameters and presets offer at least small pockets of low-to-mid savagery areas.  
Make sure your parameters and presets offer enough low-to-mid savagery, evil/good appropriate, biome appropriate squares to establish sites.  
Dwarves, for example, require non-evil, non-good, unsavage mountain squares that aren't surrounded by the ocean.  
The world generator is having trouble placing a controllable civilization.  
This problem cannot be resolved by continuing, so you should either abort or skip all rejects for a legends-only game.  
The world generator couldn't find any civilization definitions.  
Civilizations use available plants in their surroundings as their initial crops.  
The world generator is having trouble placing farming civilizations.  
Alternatively, you can remove the requirement of a controllable civilization from the parameters, which will restrict you to adventurers (assuming an appropriate civilization is placed).
