I am overmastered by your presence!
we can both agree you are by far the most persuasive!
no one can deny your genius!
you needn't indulge my trivial thoughts!

Loyalty has value, but you should always keep the broader picture in mind.
Never lose yourself in loyalty.  You know what is best for yourself.
The whole idea of loyalty is pointless.  Acting purely out of loyalty implies acting against one's own best interest.
Don't serve anyone blindly.  You'll only get into trouble.
One must always be loyal to their cause and the ones they serve.
How can society function without loyalty?  We must be able to have faith in each other.
You must never forget true loyalty.  Repay it in full.
I consider laws to be more of a suggestion than anything.
Rules are there to be bent, but they shouldn't be flouted thoughtlessly.
Some laws are just, while others were made to be broken.
No law can do justice to the complexity of life.
Nothing gives them the right to establish these laws.
Society flourishes when law breakers are punished.
One should always respect the law.
I don't know 
 my neighbor.
Building friendships is a waste.  There is no bond that can withstand distance or a change of circumstance.
Friends are future enemies.  I don't see the difference.  People do as they must.
Be careful of your so-called friends.
When all other bonds wither, friendship will remain.
Surround yourself with friends you can trust and you will be unstoppable.
There's nothing like a good friend.
You can't always rely on your family, but it's good to know somebody is there.
Family is complicated and those ties be both a boon and a curse.  Sometimes both at once!
I hold the relationships I've forged myself over family ties I had no part in creating.
We cannot choose our families, but we can choose to avoid them.
I was always irritated by family.
Family is the true bond that keeps society thriving.
You can always rely on your family when everything else falls away.
How great it is to be surrounded by family!
Consider your loyalties carefully, adhere to them while they last, and abandon them when you must.
You should only maintain loyalty so long as something more important is not at stake.
Sometimes the blunt truth just does more damage.  Think about how the situation will unfold before you speak.
It is best not to complicate your life with lies, sure, but the truth also has its problems.
There are times when it is alright not to tell the whole truth.
Don't think about the truth, whatever that is.  Just say what needs to be said.
Is there ever a time when honesty by itself overrides other considerations?  Say what is right, not what is true.
There is no value in telling the truth thoughtlessly.  Consider the circumstances and say what is best.
Everything is so much easier when you just tell the truth.
There is nothing so important that it is worth telling a lie.
You should always tell the truth.
The struggle for power must be balanced by other considerations.
It is abhorrent to seek power over other people.
There's nothing admirable about bullying others.
You can be powerful or powerless.  The choice is yours, until somebody makes it for you.
Power over others is the only true measure of worth.
Strive for power.
Friends are nice, but you should keep your priorities straight.
It's admirable when the traditions are upheld.
Some things should never change.
I can see a place for maintaining decorum, but it's exhausting to live that way.
What do you care how I speak or how I live?
Please maintain your dignity.
Life isn't fair, and sometimes you have to do what you have to do, but working toward a balance isn't a bad thing.
Don't be afraid to do anything to get ahead in this world.
Always deal fairly.
There is a time for artful speech, and a time for blunt speech as well.
They are so full of all those big words.
Who are these mealy-mouthed cowards trying to impress?
I can appreciate the right turn of phrase.
I do admire a clever turn of phrase.
Be shrewd, but do not lose yourself in guile.
There's no value in all of this scheming I see these days.
I do admire a clever trap.
Do not hide yourself behind an unfeeling mask.
One should not complain or betray any feeling.
Personal freedom must be tempered by other considerations.
Nobody is free, and it is pointless to act as if you are.
I treasure my freedom.
You should think carefully before embarking on a joint enterprise, though there is some value in working together.
It's better to work alone when possible, I think.  Cooperation breeds weakness.
We should all work together.
Art is complicated.  I know what I like, but some I can do without.
Art?  More like wasted opportunity.
What's so special about art?
The creative impulse is so valuable.
Art is life.
Some traditions are worth keeping, but we should consider their overall value.
We need to move beyond traditions.
We need to find a better way than those of before.
Some discord is a healthy part of society, but we must also try to live together.
We grow through debate and struggle, even chaos and discord.
We should all be as one.  Why all the struggling?
I like a balance of tranquility and commotion myself.
Give me the bustle and noise over all that quiet!
The mind thinks best when the world is at rest.
People should be able to control themselves, but it's fine to follow impulses that aren't too harmful.
Why deny yourself your heart's desire?
I think self-control is key.  Master yourself.
Some time spent in reflection is admirable, but you must not forget to live your life.
Why would I waste time thinking about myself?
It is important to discover yourself.
Knowledge can be useful, but it can also be pointless or even dangerous.
All of that so-called knowledge doesn't mean a thing.
The quest for knowledge never ends.
There are times when it is best to keep your feelings to yourself, but I wouldn't want to force it.
I think people should hone their skills, but it's possible to take it too far and lose sight of the breadth of life.
All of that practice is misspent effort.
Everyone should broaden their horizons.  Any work beyond learning the basics is just a waste.
The amount of practice that goes into mastering a skill is so impressive.
We should all be so lucky as to truly master a skill.
The world isn't always safe.  I can see the value in martial training, the beauty even, but it shouldn't be exalted.
Why this obsession with weapons and battle?  I don't understand some people.
A skilled warrior is a beautiful sight to behold.
A tool should get the job done, but one shouldn't obsess over the details.
Masterwork?  Why should I care?
An artisan, their materials and the tools to shape them!
I can take or leave merrymaking myself, but I don't begrudge people their enjoyment.
Merriment is worthless.
Bah!  I hope you aren't celebrating something.
It's great when we all get a chance to be merry together.
Be merry!
There is value in a good rivalry, but such danger as well.
All of this striving against one another is so foolish.
It's a competitive world, and you'd be a fool to think otherwise.
Some self-sacrifice is worthy, but do not forget yourself in devotion to the well-being of others.
Why harm yourself for anybody else's benefit?
We must be ready to sacrifice when the time comes.
Hard work is great.  Finding a way to work half as hard is even better.
I only work so hard, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.
An earnest effort at any required tasks.  That's all that's needed.
Hard work is bested by luck, connections and wealth every time.
You shouldn't whittle your life away on working.
It's foolish to work hard for anything.
The best way to get what you want out of life is to work for it.
Hard work is the true sign of character.
In life, you should work hard.  Then work harder.
There's more to life than becoming great at just one thing, but being good at several isn't bad!
I could do without all of those creatures and that tangled greenery.
It's wonderful to be out exploring the wilds!
You shouldn't get too carried away with romance, but it's fine in moderation.
These people carrying on about romance should be more practical.
There's nothing like a great romance!
There's something to be said for trade as a necessity, but there are better things in life to do with one's time.
All of this buying and selling isn't honest work.
Trade is the life-blood of a thriving society.
There's some value in leisure, but one also has to engage with other aspects of life.
Time spent in leisure is such a waste.
There's work to be done!
It's best to slow down and just relax.
Wouldn't it be grand to just take my life off and do nothing for the rest of my days?
It's good to keep pushing forward, but sometimes you just have to know when it's time to stop.
Anybody that sticks to something a moment longer than they have to is an idiot.
Keep going and never quit.
People do get so carried away sometimes, but not I.
It's a great day to fall in love all over again.

Uhh...
War is sometimes necessary, but peace must be valued as well, when we can have it.
How I long for the beautiful spectacle of war!
Let there be peace throughout the world.
Nature can be enjoyed and used for myriad purposes, but there must always be respect and even fear of its power.
I'm at my best under pressure.
I don't handle pressure well.
I just don't understand these flames of passion people go on about.
I'm feeling randy today!
There's nothing to be upset about.
W... worried?  Do I look worried?
People can be so angry, and I just don't understand it.
I have trouble controlling my temper.
How can people be so glum?
It really gets me down sometimes.
Is there something to be happy about?
Be happy!
I don't understand how somebody can become so obsessed by what somebody else has.
I get so jealous sometimes.
How can someone be so consumed by hate?
Sometimes I just don't like somebody.
You don't care, so don't ask.
You're so perceptive!
It's so great when everybody just gets along.
I don't mind stirring things up.
We must be careful not to waste.
I don't always do things in the most efficient way.
Maybe I give up too early sometimes.
Get me going and I won't stop for anything.
Why must they be so violent?
There's nothing like a good brawl.
I am not governed by urges.
Sometimes I think I need a drink, but I can control myself.
So I overindulge sometimes.
I could really use a drink.
Why are they so fixated on these baubles?
Yes, I want more.  Is that so bad?
I wouldn't feel comfortable getting all dressed up.
I like to dress well.
It's not a gift if you expect something in return.
One should always return a favor.
I don't feel like I need to chase anything.
My goals are important to me.
Some people are so wrapped up in themselves.
I look splendid today.
I don't think I'm cut out for this.
We will be successful.
Bravery is not a strength of mine.
Have no fear.
I'm not much of a decision maker.
I was never one to follow advice.
What's this about proper living?
I try to live and behave properly.
Who cares what they think?
I wonder what they think.
I don't really want to know.
I'm curious.  Tell me everything!
It won't turn out well.
I'm feeling optimistic about the future.
Huh?  What was that?
I'm concentrating on something.
Show some mercy now and again.
There's no room for mercy in this world.
Oh, I'm nothing special.
I am a very, very important person.
You shouldn't waste your life on revenge.
Don't get on my bad side.
That isn't funny.
Did you hear the one about the 
I don't like being obligated to anybody.
Do your duty.
Why should I help?
I'm happy to help.
Don't bother trying to play on my emotions.
I go with the flow sometimes.
I don't really get attached to people.
Friendship is forever.
I don't understand why they have to be that way.
Everybody has their own way of life.
Try to keep an open mind.
I'm not going to change my mind.
It's not perfect, but it's good enough.  Why fret about it?
If you have a task, do it properly.
I could tell you all about it!
I don't feel like telling you about it.
Try to focus on the practical side of the matter.
Do you have dreams?  Tell me a story!
I'd just as soon not have anything too exciting happen today.
I need some more excitement in my life.
What's the rush?
There's so much to be done!
I try not to interrupt.
People should listen to what I have to say.
I prefer to be by myself.
It's such a joy to be with people.
My trust is earned, and not by many.
People are basically trustworthy.
It's my mess.
Everything just so in its proper place!
One must always carefully consider the correct course of action.
Oh, I don't usually think much.
I'm doing 
I've been under some pressure.
I get fed up sometimes.
I've been feeling anxious.
It's all starting to get me down.
I'm feeling really worn down.
I feel angry all the time.
I can't take much more of this!
I feel so tired of everything.
I just don't care anymore...
I'm feel like I'm about to snap.
Everything is all piling up at once!
I cannot stand the world any longer...
I guess I just don't appreciate art.
A great piece of art is one that moves me.
I encountered a fascinating conundrum recently.
How incredibly satisfying!
The pain!
Waaaaa...
Rawr!!!
The horror...
Ah...  uh...
Somebody help!
I'm 
just fine
I feel 
I've been 
good
Everything's 
alright
well
fine
Yes!  It is done.
I am so enraged!
Fantastic!
I cannot be overwhelmed by grief!
The horror consumes me!
What's that?!
What's going on?!
That's incredibly suspicious!
I can't believe how great I feel!
What is the meaning of it all?!
Eek!
Ahhhhhhh!  No!
Every last one of you will pay with your lives!
Such sweet bliss!
The love overwhelms me!
Oh joyous occasion!
I feel so alienated...
The agony is too much!
This is so aggravating!
How agitating!
How affectionate I am!
Such adoration I feel!
How admirable!
I am in complete accord with this!
I must press on!
I will take revenge!

I am so happy!
That was very satisfying!
I feel such unbearable sadness...
I must not succumb to fear!
I'm awe-struck!
I really need to get away from this.
Astonishing!
I am very aroused!
I could not care less.
I'm so anxious!
So annoying!
That's annoying.
I'm annoyed.
It's annoying.
How annoying!
The anguish is overwhelming...
I am so angry!
Ha ha!  So amusing!
I am so torn over this...
Wow!  That's amazing!
What shall I do?  This is a disaster!
I am very, very displeased.
Everything is coming apart!
I feel such an intense dislike...
How naive I was...  this strikes me to the core.
How disgusting!
My disappointment is palpable!
I despair at this!
How very delightful!
I feel so dejected...
I am so content about this.
I can't describe the contempt I feel...
I'm so incredibly confused...
I care so much!
This is so boring!
I'm terribly bitter about this...

The gloom blankets me...
Glee!
How frustrating!
Such a fright!

You will know my ferocity!
How exhilarating!
So exasperating!
How enjoyable!

I feel such empathy!
How embarrassing!
Such elation I feel!
I can't wait to get to it!
Such jubilation I feel!
How jovial I feel!
Such a jolly time!
I feel so isolated!
How irritating!
How incredibly interesting!
Such an offense!
The humiliation!
There is no hope!
I am filled with such hope!
I am consumed by hatred.
Such happiness!
The guilt is almost unbearable!
Not that it's your business!  Harumph!
It makes me so grouchy!
I am so grateful!
Such rejection!  I cannot stand it.
Such total rapture!
I am so proud!
How pleasurable!
I burn with such passion!
My patience is as the still waters.
I'm panicking!  I'm panicking!
This is such an outrage!
My optimism is unshakeable!
Such nostalgia!
I am so nervous!
The mortification overwhelms me!

I'm overcome by lust!
I'm so terribly lonely!
I crawl with such unbearable loathing!
Such unhappiness!
I feel so uneasy!
It's so thrilling!
The tenderness I feel!
I feel such sympathy!
I am so ashamed!
I can't take it!
I live to serve...  my dear master...
Why does it keep happening to me?  Why me?!
I have been so wronged!
I feel so restless!
I am overcome by such resentment...
I repent!  I repent!
I feel such remorse!
I have so many regrets...
Such a relief!
Most shocking!
That's alarming!
That's suspicious!
This is so exciting!
Such gaiety!
I feel so good!
This cannot possibly end well...
Let's go!
I am wracked by doubts!
I know it will come to pass!
I feel so defeated...
What am I even doing here?
Nothing shall stand in my way!
I am filled with such wrath!
I'm so worried!
The wonder!
I adore this.
I admire this.
I accept this.
I am not scared!
I will have my revenge.
How blissful I am.
This is love.
This is a joyous time.
I am very satisfied.
I cannot give in to sadness.
Begone fear!
It is done.
I am about to lose it!
This is great!

So disgusting...

This is delightful!
I'm feeling very dejected.

Contemptible!
