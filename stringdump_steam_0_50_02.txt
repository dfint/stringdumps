Welcome to Dwarf Fortress
Would you like your fortress located in a forested mineral-rich region of this world where you can play through a short tutorial? 
Quick start and short tutorial?
Deal with challenges as they arise, and you might one day find that your humble settlement has grown to become a Mountainhome, the center of your civilization.
As you dig deeper and more citizens take up residence in your outpost, your doings will attract attention, both wanted and unwanted.

Most [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0] require building material, such as [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:1]Boulders[C:7:0:0].

Before you start chopping down trees you may want to create a dedicated [C:6:0:0]Wood Stockpile[C:7:0:0].  
First you need building materials, like [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:1]Boulders[C:7:0:0].  
With shelter ready underground, it's time to build.  
If the fallen logs are accessible, everyone will help store them in the [C:6:0:0]Stockpile[C:7:0:0].  
Now we just need to wait for the woodcutter to chop down the tree.  
Make sure your woodcutter can walk to the designated location.

Most objects that are placed, like [C:6:0:1]Doors[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:1]Furniture[C:7:0:0], must first be built in a [C:6:0:0]Workshop[C:7:0:0].  
Your industrious citizens will perform any task added to the [C:6:0:0]Workshop[C:7:0:0].  
Once the worker is done, click on the building to select it.

Now that you have a [C:6:0:1]Bed[C:7:0:0] you can place in it the fortress.  
Chop down more trees if necessary.  Unpause and wait for the [C:6:0:1]Bed[C:7:0:0] to be completed.

The highest mountain elevations do not have soil. 
The underground rectangle must be near the surface, where there is soil (loam, clay, or sand.) One level down should suffice, before you hit rock. 
Using [C:5:0:1]Mining[C:7:0:0] orders, you'll need to carve out a rectangular area underground for your [C:6:0:0]Farmplot[C:7:0:0]. 
The [C:6:0:0]Wagon[C:7:0:0] comes with some [C:6:0:1]Seeds[C:7:0:0], but as you might expect, these crops must be grown underground!
Select [C:5:0:1]Farmplot[C:7:0:0] from the [C:5:0:1]Build[C:7:0:0] menu.  It's in [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Farming[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Farmplot[C:7:0:0].  Place the [C:6:0:0]Farmplot[C:7:0:0] on the subterranean soil.
This isn't rich soil, but will suffice for now.  Dig deeper to find better soil. 
With a subterranean soil floor exposed, you can place an underground [C:6:0:0]Farmplot[C:7:0:0].

Do this by selecting [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Farming[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Fishery[C:7:0:0].
Remember, your workers do not eat raw fish!  You must build a [C:6:0:0]Fishery[C:7:0:0] to prepare them. 
You can optionally choose to designate a [C:3:0:0]Fishing[C:7:0:0] zone if you don't want your workers going far afield.

Note that you can obtain aboveground [C:6:0:1]Seeds[C:7:0:0] from trade or by eating gathered [C:6:0:1]Plants[C:7:0:0], but aboveground farming exposes your [C:2:0:0]Planters[C:7:0:0] to dangers and the elements.
[C:6:0:1]Plump Helmets[C:7:0:0] are edible and the default [C:6:0:0]Wagon[C:7:0:0] comes with [C:6:0:1]Plump Helmet Spawn[C:7:0:0], which are their "seeds".

You need to select the crops to be grown each season. 
These effects are more pronounced deep underground where you can locate the cavern biome and its rich soil.
[C:6:0:1]Fertilizer[C:7:0:0] and skilled [C:2:0:0]Planters[C:7:0:0] have a direct impact on crop yield. 
If you'd like to focus a few of your citizens on farming, which gives skill benefits, you can assign them to the [C:2:0:0]Planters[C:7:0:0] work detail from the [C:5:0:1]Labor[C:7:0:0] menu. 
Now your [C:2:0:0]Planters[C:7:0:0], those that can access both the [C:6:0:0]Farmplot[C:7:0:0] and the [C:6:0:1]Spawn[C:7:0:0], will plant the field, and after a period of growth, they'll be harvested. 
add button to assign the [C:2:0:0]Animals[C:7:0:0].
To keep them alive use the [C:3:0:0]Pen/Pasture[C:7:0:0] zone from the [C:5:0:1]Zones[C:7:0:0] menu to select a section of grass and click the 
Note that some [C:2:0:0]Livestock[C:7:0:0] must eat vegetation to survive. 
There you can select which [C:2:0:0]Animals[C:7:0:0] to slaughter.  You may need to minimize the tutorial to see the [C:5:0:1]Slaughter[C:7:0:0] buttons.
[C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] are placed much like [C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0]. 
There are several kinds of [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0], which you can see in the panel on the left.
[C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] are areas you designate where your citizens will work, socialize, rest, or perform specific duties. 
Zones
[C:7:0:1]Butchering[C:7:0:0]
Then draw a rectangle over the bushes you wish to search.
It is possible to survive by gathering plants outside.  Do this by selecting the [C:5:0:1]Gathering[C:7:0:0] order. 
[C:7:0:1]Gathering[C:7:0:0]
Once the shop is built, open the [C:5:0:1]Creatures[C:7:0:0] info menu.  From there select the [C:5:0:1]Pets/Livestock[C:7:0:0] tab. 
Do this by selecting the building in [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Farming[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Butcher[C:7:0:0]. 
To slaughter an [C:2:0:0]Animal[C:7:0:0] you must first build a [C:6:0:0]Butcher's Shop[C:7:0:0]. 
[C:6:0:1]Meat[C:7:0:0] from [C:2:0:0]Livestock[C:7:0:0] you slaughter is a source of food. 
Each [C:6:0:0]Track Stop[C:7:0:0] must be linked to a [C:6:0:0]Stockpile[C:7:0:0] for [C:6:0:1]Items[C:7:0:0] to be put on or removed from the [C:6:0:1]Minecart[C:7:0:0].
One [C:6:0:1]Minecart[C:7:0:0] can be assigned to each route, and workers will move the vehicle from [C:6:0:0]Track Stop[C:7:0:0] to [C:6:0:0]Track Stop[C:7:0:0] according to conditions you specify.
[C:6:0:1]Minecarts[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:0]Tracks[C:7:0:0] are a convenient way to move a lot of objects around the fortress quickly, though they take a little effort to prepare. 
Minecart routes
Stocks
When a route has a steep descent, consider using powered [C:6:0:0]Rollers[C:7:0:0], extra curves, track "stops" between [C:6:0:0]Stops[C:7:0:0] with various friction settings, or a worker to guide the vehicle.
[C:6:0:1]Minecarts[C:7:0:0] that move too quickly around corners will spill their contents. 
Only one condition needs to be satisfied for the [C:6:0:1]Minecart[C:7:0:0] to move to the next [C:6:0:0]Track Stop[C:7:0:0].
Burrows
Just make sure you have the correct [C:6:0:0]Furniture[C:7:0:0] placed in the rooms with [C:6:0:0]Doors[C:7:0:0] or vertical entries separating each room before you begin.
Certain [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] like [C:3:0:0]Bedrooms[C:7:0:0] can be placed several at a time. 
Unlike [C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0], multiple [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] can overlap.
It can be useful to assign all of your civilians to a safe emergency [C:1:0:0]Burrow[C:7:0:0] which you activate in case of intruders.
[C:1:0:0]Burrows[C:7:0:0] can be suspended and unsuspended freely.  When a [C:1:0:0]Burrow[C:7:0:0] is suspended, assigned citizens will ignore it.
Workers will try to limit their tasks to the confines of the [C:1:0:0]Burrow[C:7:0:0], but they will sometimes form paths which pass through other areas.
[C:1:0:0]Burrows[C:7:0:0] are work and living areas where citizens can be assigned. 
Once the first leader is assigned, subsequent [C:5:0:0]Captain[C:7:0:0] positions will appear. 
[C:5:0:0]Militia Commanders[C:7:0:0] are assigned here. 
Here you can view your nobles, as well as assign your administrators, military leaders, and other officials.
Nobles and administrators
Nobles and certain administrators require rooms, and some may also make demands.
Once they are assigned, you can create work orders, run a [C:1:0:1]Hospital[C:7:0:0], and count and appraise your hoard.
Certain important functions in your fortress can only be performed by assigned administrators, such as the [C:5:0:0]Manager[C:7:0:0] and [C:5:0:0]Bookkeeper[C:7:0:0]. 
These can also be assigned from the squad menu.
Work details are one way you can control which workers do which tasks, and they are the only way to assign certain tasks like mining, woodcutting, hunting, and fishing. 
If you don't have a [C:5:0:0]Bookkeeper[C:7:0:0], or they don't have an [C:3:0:0]Office[C:7:0:0] to work in, numbers may be approximate.
Click on category headings to collapse and expand them. 
Here you can see every [C:6:0:1]Item[C:7:0:0] in the fortress. 
If a task does not have a default work detail, you can create a custom work detail.  Once you assign citizens to the task, you can then set [C:5:0:1]"Only selected do this"[C:7:0:0] if you want to restrict it.
Tasks are restricted by setting their work detail to [C:5:0:1]"Only selected do this"[C:7:0:0].
Citizens are restricted by using their [C:5:0:1]Specialization[C:7:0:0] button. 
Generally, almost every task will be available for every citizen, but you can both restrict both citizens and tasks. 
Here you can create squads, fill their positions, assign equipment and schedules, and give specific orders.
This is the squad menu. 
Squads
Officers may opt for physical punishment if they cannot carry out custodial sentences.
You have no idea what's lurking out there.
It is recommended that you prepare a squad and get them training as soon as you can. 
Wildlife and even your own citizens can still be dangerous at times.
Although this location is relatively safe, it is recommended that you prepare a squad and get them training at some point. 
It's up to you to choose whom to convict. 
Certain crimes are indicative of larger problems, so you should pay attention to them, and affected victims and family members get upset if crime is ignored.
If you have a law enforcement administrator like a [C:5:0:0]Sheriff[C:7:0:0] or [C:5:0:0]Captain of the Guard[C:7:0:0], witnesses of crimes will make reports, which find their way here. 
Justice
It is recommended to place a certain number of [C:6:0:0]Cages[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:0]Chains[C:7:0:0] and assign them to a [C:3:0:0]Dungeon[C:7:0:0] zone. 
This is particularly important for schemes where the witnesses might not have the full story.
You can also interrogate suspects. 
All available witness information is presented for each case. 
If you find that your stockpiles are filling up too fast, you can create room by building [C:6:0:1]Bins[C:7:0:0], 
The system is reasonably powerful and you can eventually automate almost all of your production if you wish.
You can also create work orders at specific [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0] from their building sheet. 
You can limit work orders to a number of [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0]. 
the [C:6:0:0]Stoneworker's Shop[C:7:0:0] and the [C:6:0:0]Metalsmith's Forge[C:7:0:0].  [C:6:0:1]Bags[C:7:0:0] are created at the [C:6:0:0]Clothier's Shop[C:7:0:0] or the [C:6:0:0]Leatherworks[C:7:0:0].
The [C:6:0:0]Carpenter's Workshop[C:7:0:0] is the best place to make lightweight [C:6:0:1]Bins[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:1]Barrels[C:7:0:0], but they can also be made at 
(and some other things like [C:6:0:1]Sand[C:7:0:0]).  [C:6:0:1]Bins[C:7:0:0] hold just about everything else except [C:6:0:1]Furniture[C:7:0:0], [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:1]Boulders[C:7:0:0]. 
[C:6:0:1]Barrels[C:7:0:0], and [C:6:0:1]Bags[C:7:0:0].  [C:6:0:1]Barrels[C:7:0:0] are used to store [C:6:0:1]Food[C:7:0:0].  [C:6:0:1]Bags[C:7:0:0] are used to store [C:6:0:1]Seeds[C:7:0:0] 
You can also cause trouble if you'd like to raid your neighbors. 
Stolen [C:6:0:1]Artifacts[C:7:0:0] and kidnapped citizens can be recovered by preparing missions from this screen. 
The world created at the beginning of the game is active, and others may take an interest in your outpost as it grows. 
The World
For instance, you can create an order to [C:3:0:1]Make Wooden Bins[C:7:0:0] if you are out of empty ones, to [C:3:0:1]Brew Drinks[C:7:0:0] if you are running low, or to [C:3:0:1]Make Five Statues[C:7:0:0] every month.
These work orders are set to complete a certain number of [C:3:0:1]Tasks[C:7:0:0] and can be given start conditions.
Work orders are used to automate [C:3:0:1]Tasks[C:7:0:0] in [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0]. 
Raids are created by clicking on any site not belonging to your civilization.
You can create these with [C:5:0:1]Zones[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Office[C:7:0:0]. 
Some [C:5:0:0]Administrators[C:7:0:0] will require [C:3:0:0]Offices[C:7:0:0] to perform their work. 
To do this select the [C:5:0:1]Nobles and administrators[C:7:0:0] menu and click the add button to assign somebody. 
In order for some functions to be used, like work orders or bookkeeping, [C:5:0:0]Administrators[C:7:0:0] must be assigned. 
the game progresses.  Use the [C:5:0:1]Nobles and administrators[C:7:0:0] menu to check their wants and needs.
Other nobles may appear or be assigned as 
Remember to assign the [C:5:0:0]Administrator[C:7:0:0] to the [C:3:0:0]Office[C:7:0:0].
The [C:3:0:0]Zone[C:7:0:0] you select must contain a [C:6:0:0]Chair[C:7:0:0], or you can paint a [C:3:0:0]Zone[C:7:0:0] and place a [C:6:0:0]Chair[C:7:0:0] later.

When trading you select which goods you want from the list on the left, and which goods of yours to 
lock the ways into your fortress.  The ways to build traps are as wild as your imagination. 
The best way to avoid this fate is to build traps and 
you can succumb to invasions. 
It is a dangerous world, and if the entrances of your fortress are left open, 
or raise the [C:6:0:0]Bridge[C:7:0:0], locking you inside. 
Then click on the [C:6:0:0]Lever[C:7:0:0] and choose to link it to a [C:6:0:0]Bridge[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:0]Door[C:7:0:0].  This will lock the [C:6:0:0]Door[C:7:0:0] 
To stop some enemies from entering your fortress use [C:5:0:1]Build[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Machines/fluids[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Lever[C:7:0:0] to build a [C:6:0:0]Lever[C:7:0:0]. 
Most require [C:6:0:1]Mechanisms[C:7:0:0] made at the [C:6:0:0]Mechanic's Shop[C:7:0:0], using [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Mechanic[C:7:0:0]. 
If you have found magma you can build a [C:6:0:0]Magma Smelter[C:7:0:0] directly over it, otherwise you need [C:6:0:1]Fuel[C:7:0:0]. 
[C:6:0:1]Ore[C:7:0:0] is mined underground, below the soil layers.
This can done at the [C:6:0:0]Smelter[C:7:0:0] which can be found under [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Furnaces[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Smelter[C:7:0:0]. 
In order to make [C:6:0:1]Metal Bars[C:7:0:0] for the [C:2:0:0]Metalsmith[C:7:0:0], you must smelt [C:6:0:1]Ore[C:7:0:0].

found at [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Furnaces[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Wood Furnace[C:7:0:0]. 
To get [C:6:0:1]Fuel[C:7:0:0] you need to make [C:6:0:1]Charcoal[C:7:0:0] with a [C:6:0:0]Wood Furnace[C:7:0:0], 
While it is possible to trade for [C:6:0:1]Clothing[C:7:0:0], [C:6:0:1]Cloth[C:7:0:0], or [C:6:0:1]Leather[C:7:0:0], you can also farm [C:6:0:1]Pigtails[C:7:0:0], 
Eventually the [C:6:0:1]Clothing[C:7:0:0] that your residents start with will rot away. 
Repeat this pattern until you get below the aquifer.
You can then build [C:6:0:0]Walls[C:7:0:0] around the stairs until the leaking water is blocked off. 
Gathered [C:6:0:1]Silk[C:7:0:0] can go directly to the [C:6:0:0]Loom[C:7:0:0].
weave [C:6:0:1]Cloth[C:7:0:0] at the [C:6:0:0]Loom[C:7:0:0], then make [C:6:0:1]Clothing[C:7:0:0] at the [C:6:0:0]Clothier[C:7:0:0]. 
After harvesting plants like the [C:6:0:1]Pigtail[C:7:0:0], first process them at the [C:6:0:0]Farmer's Workshop[C:7:0:0], then 
gather [C:6:0:1]Silk[C:7:0:0], or tan [C:6:0:1]Skins[C:7:0:0] for [C:6:0:1]Leather[C:7:0:0].

From the [C:5:0:1]Tavern Info Menu[C:7:0:0] you can choose to assign [C:5:0:0]Performers[C:7:0:0] or a [C:5:0:0]Tavern Keeper[C:7:0:0] who will serve the 
[C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] can be assigned to special [C:1:0:1]Locations[C:7:0:0]. Usually one [C:3:0:0]Meeting Area[C:7:0:0] is sufficient, but [C:1:0:1]Locations[C:7:0:0] can span several [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0]. 
[C:3:0:0]Meeting Areas[C:7:0:0] are [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] where your citizens gather when not working or taking care of their needs. 
[C:6:0:1]Skins[C:7:0:0] are tanned at the [C:6:0:0]Tanner's Shop[C:7:0:0], and made into [C:6:0:1]Clothing[C:7:0:0] at the [C:6:0:0]Leather Works[C:7:0:0].
[C:6:0:1]Skins[C:7:0:0] can be obtained by butchering [C:2:0:0]Livestock[C:7:0:0] at the [C:6:0:0]Butcher's Shop[C:7:0:0]. 
To have a fully functioning [C:1:0:1]Tavern[C:7:0:0] you must have a [C:6:0:0]Stockpile[C:7:0:0] with [C:6:0:1]Booze[C:7:0:0] in it, preferably close by. 
[C:1:0:1]Taverns[C:7:0:0] are where your residents gather to drink, socialize, tell stories, and dance. 
[C:7:0:1]Taverns[C:7:0:0]
There are five types of [C:1:0:1]Locations[C:7:0:0], which we'll go over in turn.
[C:6:0:1]Buckets[C:7:0:0] (with a source of water), [C:6:0:1]Thread[C:7:0:0] for sutures, and [C:6:0:1]Cloth[C:7:0:0] for bandages. 
To fully function your [C:1:0:1]Hospital[C:7:0:0] needs to have [C:6:0:0]Beds[C:7:0:0], 
they are seen by a [C:5:0:0]Doctor[C:7:0:0]. 
Your unfortunate citizens are taken to the [C:1:0:1]Hospital[C:7:0:0] when injured.  There they will rest and given water until 
You will need to appoint a [C:5:0:0]
Some patients will need [C:6:0:1]Crutches[C:7:0:0] after they are treated. 
Some injuries require [C:6:0:1]Splints[C:7:0:0], or [C:6:0:1]Gypsum Plaster Powder[C:7:0:0] for [C:6:0:1]Orthopedic Casts[C:7:0:0].  [C:6:0:1]Soap[C:7:0:0] is necessary to prevent infection. 
You must build [C:6:0:0]Chests[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:0]Coffers[C:7:0:0] inside the [C:1:0:1]Hospital[C:7:0:0] to store these items. 
In the [C:6:0:1]Temple Info Menu[C:7:0:0] you can see the value of the [C:1:0:1]Temple[C:7:0:0].  Sometimes the worshipers will demand 
You can see how many worshipers of each deity live in your fortress by scrolling over their names. 
Sometimes the adherents to a certain religion will demand that you build a [C:1:0:1]Temple[C:7:0:0] to their specific deity. 
Upon creation of the [C:1:0:1]Location[C:7:0:0] you must choose which deity to dedicate the [C:1:0:1]Temple[C:7:0:0] to, if any. 
[C:7:0:1]Hospitals[C:7:0:0]
You can also assign [C:5:0:0]Performers[C:7:0:0] to the [C:1:0:1]Temple[C:7:0:0] and even [C:5:0:0]Priests[C:7:0:0] once the [C:1:0:1]Temple[C:7:0:0] becomes more established.
You can also add [C:6:0:0]Chests[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:0]Coffers[C:7:0:0] to hold [C:6:0:1]Musical Instruments[C:7:0:0] that the faithful will use.

You wish to make an offering?  We love gifts.
You wish to make an offering to our leader?  
I am a merchant, yes.  You see, I wish to trade.  Which of my goods do you desire?
Yes, and trade we will!  Simply tell me

going there.  Obviously, your copious wit is matched only by your industry!

I wish I could take so much, but my animals...
I must make a profit.  There is simply not enough value here.
I cannot take so much -- and at such cost!
Do not tempt me!  My beasts of burden cannot possibly haul such a load.
Leave it to the besotted dullard to miss the finer points of discourse.  I'm leaving.  Do reflect.
Your childish games have made me tired.  Perhaps next time I visit you'll take this seriously.
I won't trade at a loss.
Please understand the journey must be profitable.  Perhaps you'd consider tossing in a little extra?
Even with your combined trade goods, such as they are, I can't 
fathom you ending up with the items you desire.
You'll need more goods to make this arrangement.  
All I see here is not enough.
I will see that our leader gets this offering.
Take what you wish.  I can't stop you.
Ah, wonderful.  Thank you for your business.
You are too kind.

One should always respect the law.
I don't know 
Nothing gives them the right to establish these laws.
Society flourishes when law breakers are punished.
Some laws are just, while others were made to be broken.
No law can do justice to the complexity of life.
I consider laws to be more of a suggestion than anything.
Rules are there to be bent, but they shouldn't be flouted thoughtlessly.
How can society function without loyalty?  We must be able to have faith in each other.
You must never forget true loyalty.  Repay it in full.
Don't serve anyone blindly.  You'll only get into trouble.
One must always be loyal to their cause and the ones they serve.
Never lose yourself in loyalty.  You know what is best for yourself.
The whole idea of loyalty is pointless.  Acting purely out of loyalty implies acting against one's own best interest.
You should only maintain loyalty so long as something more important is not at stake.
Loyalty has value, but you should always keep the broader picture in mind.
How great it is to be surrounded by family!
Consider your loyalties carefully, adhere to them while they last, and abandon them when you must.
Family is the true bond that keeps society thriving.
You can always rely on your family when everything else falls away.
We cannot choose our families, but we can choose to avoid them.
I was always irritated by family.
Family is complicated and those ties be both a boon and a curse.  Sometimes both at once!
I hold the relationships I've forged myself over family ties I had no part in creating.
There's nothing like a good friend.
You can't always rely on your family, but it's good to know somebody is there.
When all other bonds wither, friendship will remain.
Surround yourself with friends you can trust and you will be unstoppable.
Friends are future enemies.  I don't see the difference.  People do as they must.
Be careful of your so-called friends.
Friends are nice, but you should keep your priorities straight.
Building friendships is a waste.  There is no bond that can withstand distance or a change of circumstance.

.  What happened to bring us to this?
Some traditions are worth keeping, but we should consider their overall value.
We need to move beyond traditions.
The creative impulse is so valuable.
Art is life.
Art?  More like wasted opportunity.
What's so special about art?
We should all work together.
Art is complicated.  I know what I like, but some I can do without.
You should think carefully before embarking on a joint enterprise, though there is some value in working together.
It's better to work alone when possible, I think.  Cooperation breeds weakness.
Nobody is free, and it is pointless to act as if you are.
I treasure my freedom.
One should not complain or betray any feeling.
Personal freedom must be tempered by other considerations.
There are times when it is best to keep your feelings to yourself, but I wouldn't want to force it.
Do not hide yourself behind an unfeeling mask.
All of that so-called knowledge doesn't mean a thing.
The quest for knowledge never ends.
It is important to discover yourself.
Knowledge can be useful, but it can also be pointless or even dangerous.
Some time spent in reflection is admirable, but you must not forget to live your life.
Why would I waste time thinking about myself?
Why deny yourself your heart's desire?
I think self-control is key.  Master yourself.
The mind thinks best when the world is at rest.
People should be able to control themselves, but it's fine to follow impulses that aren't too harmful.
I like a balance of tranquility and commotion myself.
Give me the bustle and noise over all that quiet!
We grow through debate and struggle, even chaos and discord.
We should all be as one.  Why all the struggling?
Be merry!
Some discord is a healthy part of society, but we must also try to live together.
Power over others is the only true measure of worth.
Strive for power.
There's nothing admirable about bullying others.
You can be powerful or powerless.  The choice is yours, until somebody makes it for you.
The struggle for power must be balanced by other considerations.
It is abhorrent to seek power over other people.
There is nothing so important that it is worth telling a lie.
You should always tell the truth.
There is no value in telling the truth thoughtlessly.  Consider the circumstances and say what is best.
Everything is so much easier when you just tell the truth.
Don't think about the truth, whatever that is.  Just say what needs to be said.
Is there ever a time when honesty by itself overrides other considerations?  Say what is right, not what is true.
It is best not to complicate your life with lies, sure, but the truth also has its problems.
There are times when it is alright not to tell the whole truth.
I do admire a clever trap.
Sometimes the blunt truth just does more damage.  Think about how the situation will unfold before you speak.
Be shrewd, but do not lose yourself in guile.
There's no value in all of this scheming I see these days.
I can appreciate the right turn of phrase.
I do admire a clever turn of phrase.
They are so full of all those big words.
Who are these mealy-mouthed cowards trying to impress?
Always deal fairly.
There is a time for artful speech, and a time for blunt speech as well.
Life isn't fair, and sometimes you have to do what you have to do, but working toward a balance isn't a bad thing.
Don't be afraid to do anything to get ahead in this world.
What do you care how I speak or how I live?
Please maintain your dignity.
Some things should never change.
I can see a place for maintaining decorum, but it's exhausting to live that way.
We need to find a better way than those of before.
It's admirable when the traditions are upheld.
It's good to keep pushing forward, but sometimes you just have to know when it's time to stop.
Anybody that sticks to something a moment longer than they have to is an idiot.
It's best to slow down and just relax.
Wouldn't it be grand to just take my life off and do nothing for the rest of my days?
Time spent in leisure is such a waste.
There's work to be done!
Trade is the life-blood of a thriving society.
There's some value in leisure, but one also has to engage with other aspects of life.
There's something to be said for trade as a necessity, but there are better things in life to do with one's time.
All of this buying and selling isn't honest work.
These people carrying on about romance should be more practical.
There's nothing like a great romance!
It's wonderful to be out exploring the wilds!
You shouldn't get too carried away with romance, but it's fine in moderation.
Nature can be enjoyed and used for myriad purposes, but there must always be respect and even fear of its power.
I could do without all of those creatures and that tangled greenery.
How I long for the beautiful spectacle of war!
Let there be peace throughout the world.
Uhh...
War is sometimes necessary, but peace must be valued as well, when we can have it.

the theme of 
Sometimes I just don't like somebody.
People do get so carried away sometimes, but not I.
Bah!  I hope you aren't celebrating something.
It's great when we all get a chance to be merry together.
I can take or leave merrymaking myself, but I don't begrudge people their enjoyment.
Merriment is worthless.
Masterwork?  Why should I care?
An artisan, their materials and the tools to shape them!
A skilled warrior is a beautiful sight to behold.
A tool should get the job done, but one shouldn't obsess over the details.
The world isn't always safe.  I can see the value in martial training, the beauty even, but it shouldn't be exalted.
Why this obsession with weapons and battle?  I don't understand some people.
The amount of practice that goes into mastering a skill is so impressive.
We should all be so lucky as to truly master a skill.
All of that practice is misspent effort.
Everyone should broaden their horizons.  Any work beyond learning the basics is just a waste.
There's more to life than becoming great at just one thing, but being good at several isn't bad!
I think people should hone their skills, but it's possible to take it too far and lose sight of the breadth of life.
Hard work is the true sign of character.
In life, you should work hard.  Then work harder.
It's foolish to work hard for anything.
The best way to get what you want out of life is to work for it.
Hard work is bested by luck, connections and wealth every time.
You shouldn't whittle your life away on working.
I only work so hard, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.
An earnest effort at any required tasks.  That's all that's needed.
We must be ready to sacrifice when the time comes.
Hard work is great.  Finding a way to work half as hard is even better.
Some self-sacrifice is worthy, but do not forget yourself in devotion to the well-being of others.
Why harm yourself for anybody else's benefit?
All of this striving against one another is so foolish.
It's a competitive world, and you'd be a fool to think otherwise.
Keep going and never quit.
There is value in a good rivalry, but such danger as well.
I was never one to follow advice.
What's this about proper living?
Have no fear.
I'm not much of a decision maker.
We will be successful.
Bravery is not a strength of mine.
I look splendid today.
I don't think I'm cut out for this.
My goals are important to me.
Some people are so wrapped up in themselves.
One should always return a favor.
I don't feel like I need to chase anything.
I like to dress well.
It's not a gift if you expect something in return.
Did you hear the one about the 
I wouldn't feel comfortable getting all dressed up.
Don't get on my bad side.
That isn't funny.
I am a very, very important person.
You shouldn't waste your life on revenge.
There's no room for mercy in this world.
Oh, I'm nothing special.
I'm concentrating on something.
Show some mercy now and again.
I'm feeling optimistic about the future.
Huh?  What was that?
I'm curious.  Tell me everything!
It won't turn out well.
I wonder what they think.
I don't really want to know.
I don't feel like telling you about it.
Who cares what they think?
I get so jealous sometimes.
How can someone be so consumed by hate?
Be happy!
I don't understand how somebody can become so obsessed by what somebody else has.
It really gets me down sometimes.
Is there something to be happy about?
I have trouble controlling my temper.
How can people be so glum?
W... worried?  Do I look worried?
People can be so angry, and I just don't understand it.
I'm feeling randy today!
There's nothing to be upset about.
I don't handle pressure well.
I just don't understand these flames of passion people go on about.
Yes, I want more.  Is that so bad?
I'm at my best under pressure.
I could really use a drink.
Why are they so fixated on these baubles?
Sometimes I think I need a drink, but I can control myself.
So I overindulge sometimes.
There's nothing like a good brawl.
I am not governed by urges.
Get me going and I won't stop for anything.
Why must they be so violent?
I don't always do things in the most efficient way.
Maybe I give up too early sometimes.
I don't mind stirring things up.
We must be careful not to waste.
You're so perceptive!
It's so great when everybody just gets along.
I try to live and behave properly.
You don't care, so don't ask.
I guess I just don't appreciate art.
A great piece of art is one that moves me.
Everything is all piling up at once!
I cannot stand the world any longer...
I just don't care anymore...
I'm feel like I'm about to snap.
I can't take much more of this!
I feel so tired of everything.
I'm feeling really worn down.
I feel angry all the time.
I've been feeling anxious.
It's all starting to get me down.
I've been under some pressure.
I get fed up sometimes.

Waaaaa...

How incredibly satisfying!
If you have a task, do it properly.
I could tell you all about it!
I'm not going to change my mind.
It's not perfect, but it's good enough.  Why fret about it?
Everybody has their own way of life.
Try to keep an open mind.
Friendship is forever.
I don't understand why they have to be that way.
I go with the flow sometimes.
I don't really get attached to people.
I'm happy to help.
Don't bother trying to play on my emotions.
Do your duty.
Why should I help?
Oh, I don't usually think much.
I don't like being obligated to anybody.
Everything just so in its proper place!
One must always carefully consider the correct course of action.
People are basically trustworthy.
It's my mess.
It's such a joy to be with people.
My trust is earned, and not by many.
People should listen to what I have to say.
I prefer to be by myself.
There's so much to be done!
I try not to interrupt.
I need some more excitement in my life.
What's the rush?
Do you have dreams?  Tell me a story!
I'd just as soon not have anything too exciting happen today.
I encountered a fascinating conundrum recently.
Try to focus on the practical side of the matter.
Ha ha!  So amusing!
I am so torn over this...
The anguish is overwhelming...
I am so angry!
It's annoying.
How annoying!
That's annoying.
I'm annoyed.
I'm so anxious!
So annoying!
I am very aroused!
I could not care less.
I really need to get away from this.
Astonishing!
I'm terribly bitter about this...
I'm awe-struck!
I care so much!
This is so boring!
I can't describe the contempt I feel...
I'm so incredibly confused...
I feel so dejected...
I am so content about this.
I despair at this!
How very delightful!
How disgusting!
My disappointment is palpable!
I feel such an intense dislike...
How naive I was...  this strikes me to the core.
I am very, very displeased.
Everything is coming apart!
I can't wait to get to it!
What shall I do?  This is a disaster!
Such sweet bliss!
The love overwhelms me!
Ahhhhhhh!  No!
Every last one of you will pay with your lives!
What is the meaning of it all?!
Eek!
That's incredibly suspicious!
I can't believe how great I feel!
What's that?!
What's going on?!
I cannot be overwhelmed by grief!
The horror consumes me!
I am so enraged!
Fantastic!
I must not succumb to fear!
Yes!  It is done.
That was very satisfying!
I feel such unbearable sadness...
I feel such love!
I am so happy!
I will take revenge!
How blissful!
I am in complete accord with this!
I must press on!
Such adoration I feel!

The agony is too much!
This is so aggravating!

I'm overcome by lust!
I'm so terribly lonely!
The mortification overwhelms me!
Such misery!
Such nostalgia!
I am so nervous!
This is such an outrage!
My optimism is unshakeable!
My patience is as the still waters.
I'm panicking!  I'm panicking!
How pleasurable!
I burn with such passion!
Such total rapture!
I am so proud!
Such a relief!
Such rejection!  I cannot stand it.
I feel such remorse!
I have so many regrets...
I am overcome by such resentment...
I repent!  I repent!
I have been so wronged!
I feel so restless!
I live to serve...  my dear master...
Why does it keep happening to me?  Why me?!
I am so ashamed!
I can't take it!

I feel such sympathy!
I feel so uneasy!
It's so thrilling!

The gloom blankets me...
Glee!
I am so grateful!
How glum I am...
Not that it's your business!  Harumph!
It makes me so grouchy!
Such happiness!
The guilt is almost unbearable!
I am filled with such hope!
I am consumed by hatred.
The humiliation!
There is no hope!
How incredibly interesting!
Such an offense!
I feel so isolated!
How irritating!
How jovial I feel!
Such a jolly time!
I crawl with such unbearable loathing!
Such jubilation I feel!
I'm very aggravated.
This is driving me to agitation.
I feel alienated.
The agony I feel...
I have strong feelings of ambivalence.
That's amazing!
I'm very angry.
That's very amusing.
That's very annoying.
I feel so anguished...
It would be hard to care less.
It makes me very anxious.
It's quite astonishing.
I'm aroused!
Awe-inspiring...
I'm very averse to this.
It's really boring.
It makes me very bitter.
I'm so confused.
I really care.
I'm very content.
Contemptible!
This is delightful!
I'm feeling very dejected.
I am very disappointed.
I feel such despair...
I've become so disillusioned.  What now?
So disgusting...
It has all gone wrong!
I really don't like this.
I'm so distressed about this!
This is quite displeasing.
I am filled with such wrath!
I'm so worried!
What am I even doing here?
Nothing shall stand in my way!
I know it will come to pass!
I feel so defeated...
Let's go!
I am wracked by doubts!
I feel so good!
This cannot possibly end well...
This is so exciting!
Such gaiety!
That's alarming!
That's suspicious!
This is truly horrifying.
Most shocking!
This is great!
I am almost overcome by grief.
It is done.
I am about to lose it!
I cannot give in to sadness.
Begone fear!
This is a joyous time.
I am very satisfied.
How blissful I am.
This is love.
I am not scared!
I will have my revenge.
I admire this.
I accept this.
I'm feeling affectionate.
I adore this.

I'm so relieved.
I must repent.
I'm truly remorseful.
I'm really restless.
I'm very resentful.
This is such a hardship for me!

This leaves me so shaken.
I live to serve.
I'm very sympathetic.
I feel such shame.
This is quite a thrill!
I feel such tenderness.
I'm very unhappy.
I feel very uneasy.
I'm so elated.
I'm very eager to get started.
I'm very empathetic.
This is so embarrassing...

I'm very fond.
I'm feeling so ferocious!
That was so frightful.
I feel so free.
I'm so gleeful.
This is very frustrating.
I feel so glum.
It makes me so gloomy.
It makes me very grouchy.
I'm very grateful.
I feel so guilty.
Harumph!
The hate burns within me.

Amusing.
I'm ambivalent.
I'm anguished.
That makes me angry.
Who cares?
I'm anxious.
It's astonishing, really.
Arousing...
It fills one with awe.
I'd like to get away from it.
It's boring.
It makes me bitter.
This is confusing.
I care.
I'm content.
I feel only contempt.
I feel some delight.
I'm dejected.
This is disappointing.
I feel despair.
This makes me question it all.
That's disgusting.
What has happened?
I dislike this.
This is distressing.
I am not pleased.
I'm very worried.
I am filled with wonder.
I shall accomplish much!
I am wrathful.
I've been defeated.
What is the meaning of life...
I'm very doubtful.
Things are going to happen.
I really don't see this working out.
I feel enthusiastic!
The gaiety I'm feeling!
I'm feeling great!
How suspicious...
This is really exciting!
I will master myself.
That was alarming.
I must let grief pass me by.
This cannot horrify me.
I'm a little angry.
I feel like a victor.
This doesn't scare me.
It has come to pass.
That was satisfying.
I feel somewhat sad.
Is this love?
This is nice.
This might require an answer.
This could be bliss.
I can accept this.

 Outpost:[C:7:0:0]  You have arrived.  After a journey from the Mountainhomes into the forbidding wilderness beyond, your harsh trek has finally ended.  Your party of seven is to make an outpost for the glory of all of 
There are almost no supplies left, but with stout labor comes sustenance.  Whether by bolt, plow or hook, provide for your 
charges

A new chapter of dwarven history begins here at this place,

An
 Outpost Revisited:[C:7:0:0]  You have returned. 
How have your sturdy charges fared in your absence? 
Have they gone on adventures or moved on to richer delving at new frontier settlements? 
Perhaps they are all still here, unwilling to leave the magnificent fortress you prepared for them.

Something evil is emerging from this newly exposed pocket!
We have unleashed the echo of a forgotten divine retribution!
Horrifying screams come from the darkness below!
Deep within this strange place, we've uncovered what must be a treasure of the gods!
We checked that stone for heat!  What devilry is this?!
Some ancient horror was encased here, until now!
Apocalypse!  We are being judged by the gods!
The glowing barrier has disappeared, replaced by terrible shrieks from the underworld!
The glowing barrier has disappeared!

[C:VAR:MEETING:ACTOR][VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:ACTOR]:  What a pleasant surprise!  Not a single tree here weeps from the abuses meted out with such ease by your people.  Joy!  The dwarves have turned a page, not that we would make paper.  A travesty!  Perhaps it is better said that the dwarves have turned over a new leaf, and the springtime for our two races has only just begun.

The world generator is having trouble placing enough civilizations.  
Make sure your parameters and presets offer enough low-to-mid savagery, evil/good appropriate, biome appropriate squares to establish sites.  
High savagery (66+) blocks civilization placement -- make sure your parameters and presets offer at least small pockets of low-to-mid savagery areas.  
If you have very few biome types and are placing good or evil regions, they'll often crowd out the civilizations as well.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of mountain caves required by the parameters.
The world generator is having trouble placing low-lying caves.  
Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many mid-elevation squares as you are requiring low-lying caves.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of non-mountain caves required by the parameters.
Dwarves, for example, require non-evil, non-good, unsavage mountain squares that aren't surrounded by the ocean.  
Make sure your parameters and presets have adequate squares of this kind.  
Alternatively, you can remove the requirement of a controllable civilization from the parameters, which will restrict you to adventurers (assuming an appropriate civilization is placed).
The world generator is having trouble placing farming civilizations.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of civilizations required by the parameters.
The world generator couldn't find any civilization definitions.  
This problem cannot be resolved by continuing, so you should either abort or skip all rejects for a legends-only game.  
The world generator is having trouble placing a controllable civilization.  
The world generator is having trouble placing grasslands.  
Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, low-to-mid rainfall, low-to-mid drainage, non-freezing areas.  
The world generator is having trouble placing hills.  
Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, low-to-mid rainfall, high drainage, non-freezing areas.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of glacial squares and regions required by the parameters.
The world generator is having trouble placing tundra regions.  
Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, low-to-mid drainage, freezing areas.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of tundra squares and regions required by the parameters.
Make sure your parameters and presets aren't so variable that biomes change frequently.  
Alternatively, you can increase the number of subregions permitted by the parameters, up to the cap.
The world generator is having trouble placing mountain caves.  
Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many border mountain squares as you are requiring mountain caves.  
The world generator is having trouble placing rivers.  
Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many mountain squares as you are requiring river start points.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of rivers required by the parameters.
The world generator is placing too many subregions.
