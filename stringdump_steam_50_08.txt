Welcome to Dwarf Fortress
Prepare to guide your stout charges to fortune in a world fraught with many perils. 
You'll begin by creating your world and watching the region's history unfold. 
Once this process is complete, you can prepare a group and send them out to seek wealth deep in the mountains.

If this is your first time playing, please heed the embark warnings about aquifers, saltwater, and other hazards. 
Some locations are challenging even for experienced players, and it will be a very short game indeed if you don't know how to deal with them!
As you dig deeper and more citizens take up residence in your outpost, your doings will attract attention, both wanted and unwanted. 
Deal with challenges as they arise, and you might one day find that your humble settlement has grown to become a Mountainhome, the center of your civilization.

order also works.
Now we'll unpause the game and let the miner finish the task.  Press 
to unpause or use the highlighted controls at the top of the screen.  You should pause regularly starting out.
Let's make a safe place to work.  Select [C:5:0:1]Regular Mining[C:7:0:0] mode, to the left of [C:5:0:1]Stair Mining[C:7:0:0] mode.
There may be plenty of hillside to dig into, but you'll want to seek wealth below the surface.
Mining tasks are designated on the play area.  Begin by clicking the highlighted [C:5:0:1]Mining[C:7:0:0] button.
There are several ways to mine.  Stairwells (selected) start at one elevation and are completed at 
the next.  [C:2:0:1]Click[C:7:0:0] the surface, [C:2:0:1]move the camera down one level[C:7:0:0], and [C:2:0:1]click[C:7:0:0] the underground.  Reversing the

It's time to get to work!  Let's start by digging a stairwell into the ground.  
] or [C:2:0:1]roll the mouse wheel[C:7:0:0].  Hold shift to move faster.
When your view is in the air above other tiles, you can see them below, but you can only interact with objects in your current elevation.
The view will be dark underground until you begin mining.  You can move the camera to the surface with the surface button (highlighted.)  The 
] hotkey will recenter on your wagon.
Once the pile is placed, click [C:5:0:1]Accept[C:7:0:0] and select the [C:5:0:1]All[C:7:0:0] option.
If unpaused, your workers should start unloading the wagon into the [C:6:0:0]Stockpile[C:7:0:0].  
Later you may want to customize your [C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0] by clicking on them and pressing the [C:5:0:1]Custom[C:7:0:0] 
button to forbid certain categories, like [C:5:0:1]Refuse[C:7:0:0] for example.  A separate [C:6:0:0]Refuse Stockpile[C:7:0:0] is a 
supplies around your fortress where they are needed.
[C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0] are placed with the [C:5:0:1]Stockpile[C:7:0:0] button (highlighted.)  Click it now.
Click the add button, and click two corners of a rectangle somewhere safe 
to place your pile.  [C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0] can be placed both on the surface and underground.  
from the [C:5:0:1]Zones[C:7:0:0] menu. Otherwise your citizens will continue to gather by the [C:6:0:0]Wagon[C:7:0:0] outside.
 (3 of 8)
The supplies on the wagon are in danger of being carried off by wild creatures!  
It's time to build a [C:6:0:0]Stockpile[C:7:0:0] underground to unload them.  [C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0] are crucial to moving 
Dig a rectangle underground big enough for a large [C:6:0:0]Stockpile[C:7:0:0] and some [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0].  
Consider that most [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0] are 3x3 squares.  Mining through the stone layers further down may take longer, 
but it leaves [C:6:0:1]Boulders[C:7:0:0] which are an essential building material.
Later you can consider making a [C:3:0:0]Meeting Area[C:7:0:0] 
You can right click to close [C:5:0:1]Woodcutting[C:7:0:0] mode.  Right clicking closes most menus.
If all of your [C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0] are full, go ahead and place another one.
 (5 of 8)
Now that you have the building materials it's time to start building.  
When you are ready, open the [C:5:0:1]Woodcutting[C:7:0:0] menu and designate the trunk of a tree on the surface.  
Make sure your woodcutter can walk to the designated location.
Now we just need to wait for the woodcutter to chop down the tree.  
If the fallen logs are accessible, everyone will help store them in the [C:6:0:0]Stockpile[C:7:0:0].  
With shelter ready underground, it's time to build.  
First you need building materials, like [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:1]Boulders[C:7:0:0].  
Before you start chopping down trees you may want to create a dedicated [C:6:0:0]Wood Stockpile[C:7:0:0].  
[C:2:0:0]Haulers[C:7:0:0] will also drop [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] in your [C:6:0:0]All Stockpile[C:7:0:0] unless you turn it off in the [C:5:0:1]Custom Stockpile Menu[C:7:0:0].
good idea to keep your fortress clean.
If the [C:5:0:1]Stockpile[C:7:0:0] menu is still open, you can close it now by right-clicking.  Right-clicking can

[C:5:0:1]Beds[C:7:0:0] are found in the [C:5:0:1]Furniture[C:7:0:0] category.  Unlike [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0], [C:6:0:0]Beds[C:7:0:0] must be placed underground.
With a [C:6:0:0]Bed[C:7:0:0] placed, your workers will have somewhere to sleep.  Later you can create a 
room with a [C:6:0:0]Door[C:7:0:0] and use the [C:5:0:1]Zones[C:7:0:0] menu to assign an official [C:3:0:0]Bedroom[C:7:0:0] for each resident.
 (6 of 8)
[C:6:0:1]Furniture[C:7:0:0] created at the [C:6:0:0]Carpenter's Workshop[C:7:0:0] usually takes one [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] to build.  Add a task and make a [C:6:0:1]Bed[C:7:0:0].  
Chop down more trees if necessary.  Unpause and wait for the [C:6:0:1]Bed[C:7:0:0] to be completed.
Now that you have a [C:6:0:1]Bed[C:7:0:0] you can place in it the fortress.  
Use the [C:5:0:1]Build[C:7:0:0] menu to place it in a room underground, just like the [C:6:0:0]Workshop[C:7:0:0].  Dig a new room first if you like.  
When unpaused, a worker should now build the [C:6:0:0]Workshop[C:7:0:0].
Once the worker is done, click on the building to select it.
Your industrious citizens will perform any task added to the [C:6:0:0]Workshop[C:7:0:0].  
Most objects that are placed, like [C:6:0:1]Doors[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:1]Furniture[C:7:0:0], must first be built in a [C:6:0:0]Workshop[C:7:0:0].  
[C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0] are one of many buildings you can place with the highlighted [C:5:0:1]Build[C:7:0:0] button.  Click it now.
Most [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0] require building material, such as [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:1]Boulders[C:7:0:0].  
If you have some [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] stockpiled, you'll be able to place a [C:6:0:0]Carpenter's Workshop[C:7:0:0].  
Click [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Carpenter[C:7:0:0] and place the shop in an empty area on the surface or underground.

Just the beginning
There's a lot more to learn!
As you enter new menus, there will be information and tips.
Make the appropriate workshop with [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Crafts[C:7:0:0]. 
An obvious material to use to make the crafts is rock. 
If you dig down enough layers you will find a near infinite amount of [C:6:0:1]Boulders[C:7:0:0] of various 
kinds as well as some [C:6:0:1]Rough Gems[C:7:0:0] if you are lucky.
You may need supplies before the coming of winter. 
To trade with the autumn caravan, you must build a [C:6:0:0]Trade Depot[C:7:0:0] from the [C:5:0:1]Build[C:7:0:0] menu.
You need something of value to trade. 
[C:6:0:1]Crafts[C:7:0:0] are an easy way to make a lot of trade goods quickly.

If you haven't suffered any casualties, you should have these labors assigned already. 
But if one of these brave workers falls, you'll need to assign somebody to these duties.

Miner
[C:7:0:1]Shelter[C:7:0:0]
By now you should have a room underground where your residents can hide from the creatures above. 
To make sure they spend their free time down there you will need to use the [C:5:0:1]Zones[C:7:0:0] menu to create a [C:3:0:0]Meeting Area[C:7:0:0]. 
Later you may try the [C:5:0:1]Burrows[C:7:0:0] menu to create a safe place for your civilians to hide when real trouble comes.
The [C:6:0:0]Wagon[C:7:0:0] comes with some [C:6:0:1]Seeds[C:7:0:0], but as you might expect, these crops must be grown underground!
Using [C:5:0:1]Mining[C:7:0:0] orders, you'll need to carve out a rectangular area underground for your [C:6:0:0]Farmplot[C:7:0:0]. 
The underground rectangle must be near the surface, where there is soil (loam, clay, or sand.) One level down should suffice, before you hit rock. 
The highest mountain elevations do not have soil. 
Absent alcohol and in warmer weather, you can designate a [C:3:0:0]Water Source[C:7:0:0] from the [C:5:0:1]Zones[C:7:0:0] menu at a river or pond, 
so that your residents have water to drink.  You'll want one of these anyway for other purposes, like cleaning 
and certain [C:6:0:0]Workshop[C:7:0:0] tasks.  You may find water underground.
There's some food on the embark [C:6:0:0]Wagon[C:7:0:0], and you can trade for food, but you can also grow your own. 
may try [C:5:0:1]Planting[C:7:0:0] or [C:5:0:1]Gathering[C:7:0:0]. 
The task also requires a [C:6:0:1]Barrel[C:7:0:0] from the [C:6:0:0]Carpenter's Workshop[C:7:0:0]. 
If you survive until the caravan comes you may also trade for [C:6:0:1]Drinks[C:7:0:0] 
or [C:6:0:1]Plants[C:7:0:0] there.  The number of [C:6:0:1]Drink[C:7:0:0] rations can be seen at the top of the screen.
There are two ways to make drinks for your residents.
The main way is by brewing alcohol. 
This is done by building a [C:6:0:0]Still[C:7:0:0] from the [C:5:0:1]Build[C:7:0:0] menu using [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Farming[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Still[C:7:0:0]. 
Once the [C:6:0:0]Still[C:7:0:0] is constructed, click on it and add the task [C:3:0:1]Brew Drink from Plant (or fruit)[C:7:0:0].  If you have no suitable [C:6:0:1]Plants[C:7:0:0], you 
[C:6:0:1]Potash[C:7:0:0] is the fertilizer of choice, and it can be created in the [C:6:0:0]Ashery[C:7:0:0], using [C:6:0:1]Ash[C:7:0:0] from [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] burned in a [C:6:0:0]Wood Furnace[C:7:0:0].  A [C:3:0:0]Water Source[C:7:0:0] zone and a [C:6:0:1]Bucket[C:7:0:0] are also required. 
[C:6:0:1]Fertilizer[C:7:0:0] is not needed to farm.
[C:7:0:1]Fishing[C:7:0:0]
If there is a river or pond nearby you may consider fishing.  If the water isn't frozen, a worker with the 
Now your [C:2:0:0]Planters[C:7:0:0], those that can access both the [C:6:0:0]Farmplot[C:7:0:0] and the [C:6:0:1]Spawn[C:7:0:0], will plant the field, and after a period of growth, they'll be harvested. 
If you'd like to focus a few of your citizens on farming, which gives skill benefits, you can assign them to the [C:2:0:0]Planters[C:7:0:0] work detail from the [C:5:0:1]Labor[C:7:0:0] menu. 
[C:6:0:1]Fertilizer[C:7:0:0] and skilled [C:2:0:0]Planters[C:7:0:0] have a direct impact on crop yield. 
These effects are more pronounced deep underground where you can locate the cavern biome and its rich soil.
You need to select the crops to be grown each season. 
Click on the [C:6:0:0]Farmplot[C:7:0:0] you placed to pull up the [C:5:0:1]Farming[C:7:0:0] menu.
[C:6:0:1]Plump Helmets[C:7:0:0] are edible and the default [C:6:0:0]Wagon[C:7:0:0] comes with [C:6:0:1]Plump Helmet Spawn[C:7:0:0], which are their "seeds".
Note that you can obtain aboveground [C:6:0:1]Seeds[C:7:0:0] from trade or by eating gathered [C:6:0:1]Plants[C:7:0:0], but aboveground farming exposes your [C:2:0:0]Planters[C:7:0:0] to dangers and the elements.
Make sure to leave the ceiling above intact so the underground soil doesn't receive any sunlight.
With a subterranean soil floor exposed, you can place an underground [C:6:0:0]Farmplot[C:7:0:0]. 
This isn't rich soil, but will suffice for now.  Dig deeper to find better soil. 
Select [C:5:0:1]Farmplot[C:7:0:0] from the [C:5:0:1]Build[C:7:0:0] menu.  It's in [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Farming[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Farmplot[C:7:0:0].  Place the [C:6:0:0]Farmplot[C:7:0:0] on the subterranean soil.
There you can select which [C:2:0:0]Animals[C:7:0:0] to slaughter.  You may need to minimize the tutorial to see the [C:5:0:1]Slaughter[C:7:0:0] buttons.
Note that some [C:2:0:0]Livestock[C:7:0:0] must eat vegetation to survive. 
To keep them alive use the [C:3:0:0]Pen/Pasture[C:7:0:0] zone from the [C:5:0:1]Zones[C:7:0:0] menu to select a section of grass and click the 
add button to assign the [C:2:0:0]Animals[C:7:0:0].
[C:6:0:1]Meat[C:7:0:0] from [C:2:0:0]Livestock[C:7:0:0] you slaughter is a source of food. 
To slaughter an [C:2:0:0]Animal[C:7:0:0] you must first build a [C:6:0:0]Butcher's Shop[C:7:0:0]. 
Do this by selecting the building in [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Farming[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Butcher[C:7:0:0]. 
Once the shop is built, open the [C:5:0:1]Creatures[C:7:0:0] info menu.  From there select the [C:5:0:1]Pets/Livestock[C:7:0:0] tab. 
[C:7:0:1]Gathering[C:7:0:0]
It is possible to survive by gathering plants outside.  Do this by selecting the [C:5:0:1]Gathering[C:7:0:0] order. 
Then draw a rectangle over the bushes you wish to search.
[C:7:0:1]Butchering[C:7:0:0]
fishing labor assigned will begin fishing automatically.
You can optionally choose to designate a [C:3:0:0]Fishing[C:7:0:0] zone if you don't want your workers going far afield.
Remember, your workers do not eat raw fish!  You must build a [C:6:0:0]Fishery[C:7:0:0] to prepare them. 
Do this by selecting [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Farming[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Fishery[C:7:0:0].
Minecart routes
[C:6:0:1]Minecarts[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:0]Tracks[C:7:0:0] are a convenient way to move a lot of objects around the fortress quickly, though they take a little effort to prepare. 
One [C:6:0:1]Minecart[C:7:0:0] can be assigned to each route, and workers will move the vehicle from [C:6:0:0]Track Stop[C:7:0:0] to [C:6:0:0]Track Stop[C:7:0:0] according to conditions you specify.
Each [C:6:0:0]Track Stop[C:7:0:0] must be linked to a [C:6:0:0]Stockpile[C:7:0:0] for [C:6:0:1]Items[C:7:0:0] to be put on or removed from the [C:6:0:1]Minecart[C:7:0:0].
[C:1:0:0]Burrows[C:7:0:0] are work and living areas where citizens can be assigned. 
Workers will try to limit their tasks to the confines of the [C:1:0:0]Burrow[C:7:0:0], but they will sometimes form paths which pass through other areas.
[C:1:0:0]Burrows[C:7:0:0] can be suspended and unsuspended freely.  When a [C:1:0:0]Burrow[C:7:0:0] is suspended, assigned citizens will ignore it.
It can be useful to assign all of your civilians to a safe emergency [C:1:0:0]Burrow[C:7:0:0] which you activate in case of intruders.
Unlike [C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0], multiple [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] can overlap.
Certain [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] like [C:3:0:0]Bedrooms[C:7:0:0] can be placed several at a time. 
Just make sure you have the correct [C:6:0:0]Furniture[C:7:0:0] placed in the rooms with [C:6:0:0]Doors[C:7:0:0] or vertical entries separating each room before you begin.
Burrows
Zones
[C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] are areas you designate where your citizens will work, socialize, rest, or perform specific duties. 
There are several kinds of [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0], which you can see in the panel on the left.
[C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] are placed much like [C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0]. 
Nobles and administrators
Here you can view your nobles, as well as assign your administrators, military leaders, and other officials.
[C:5:0:0]Militia Commanders[C:7:0:0] are assigned here. 
Once the first leader is assigned, subsequent [C:5:0:0]Captain[C:7:0:0] positions will appear. 
Generally, almost every task will be available for every citizen, but you can both restrict both citizens and tasks. 
Citizens are restricted by using their [C:5:0:1]Specialization[C:7:0:0] button. 
Tasks are restricted by setting their work detail to [C:5:0:1]"Only selected do this"[C:7:0:0].
If a task does not have a default work detail, you can create a custom work detail.  Once you assign citizens to the task, you can then set [C:5:0:1]"Only selected do this"[C:7:0:0] if you want to restrict it.
Here you can see every [C:6:0:1]Item[C:7:0:0] in the fortress. 
Click on category headings to collapse and expand them. 
If you don't have a [C:5:0:0]Bookkeeper[C:7:0:0], or they don't have an [C:3:0:0]Office[C:7:0:0] to work in, numbers may be approximate.
Work details are one way you can control which workers do which tasks, and they are the only way to assign certain tasks like mining, woodcutting, hunting, and fishing. 
Only one condition needs to be satisfied for the [C:6:0:1]Minecart[C:7:0:0] to move to the next [C:6:0:0]Track Stop[C:7:0:0].
[C:6:0:1]Minecarts[C:7:0:0] that move too quickly around corners will spill their contents. 
When a route has a steep descent, consider using powered [C:6:0:0]Rollers[C:7:0:0], extra curves, track "stops" between [C:6:0:0]Stops[C:7:0:0] with various friction settings, or a worker to guide the vehicle.
Stocks
Officers may opt for physical punishment if they cannot carry out custodial sentences.
Squads
This is the squad menu. 
Here you can create squads, fill their positions, assign equipment and schedules, and give specific orders.
All available witness information is presented for each case. 
You can also interrogate suspects. 
This is particularly important for schemes where the witnesses might not have the full story.
It is recommended to place a certain number of [C:6:0:0]Cages[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:0]Chains[C:7:0:0] and assign them to a [C:3:0:0]Dungeon[C:7:0:0] zone. 
Justice
If you have a law enforcement administrator like a [C:5:0:0]Sheriff[C:7:0:0] or [C:5:0:0]Captain of the Guard[C:7:0:0], witnesses of crimes will make reports, which find their way here. 
Certain crimes are indicative of larger problems, so you should pay attention to them, and affected victims and family members get upset if crime is ignored.
It's up to you to choose whom to convict. 
These can also be assigned from the squad menu.
Certain important functions in your fortress can only be performed by assigned administrators, such as the [C:5:0:0]Manager[C:7:0:0] and [C:5:0:0]Bookkeeper[C:7:0:0]. 
Once they are assigned, you can create work orders, run a [C:1:0:1]Hospital[C:7:0:0], and count and appraise your hoard.
Nobles and certain administrators require rooms, and some may also make demands.
You can limit work orders to a number of [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0]. 
You can also create work orders at specific [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0] from their building sheet. 
The system is reasonably powerful and you can eventually automate almost all of your production if you wish.
If you find that your stockpiles are filling up too fast, you can create room by building [C:6:0:1]Bins[C:7:0:0], 
Raids are created by clicking on any site not belonging to your civilization.
Work orders are used to automate [C:3:0:1]Tasks[C:7:0:0] in [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0]. 
These work orders are set to complete a certain number of [C:3:0:1]Tasks[C:7:0:0] and can be given start conditions.
For instance, you can create an order to [C:3:0:1]Make Wooden Bins[C:7:0:0] if you are out of empty ones, to [C:3:0:1]Brew Drinks[C:7:0:0] if you are running low, or to [C:3:0:1]Make Five Statues[C:7:0:0] every month.
The World
The world created at the beginning of the game is active, and others may take an interest in your outpost as it grows. 
Stolen [C:6:0:1]Artifacts[C:7:0:0] and kidnapped citizens can be recovered by preparing missions from this screen. 
You can also cause trouble if you'd like to raid your neighbors. 
Although this location is relatively safe, it is recommended that you prepare a squad and get them training at some point. 
Wildlife and even your own citizens can still be dangerous at times.
It is recommended that you prepare a squad and get them training as soon as you can. 
You have no idea what's lurking out there.
In order for some functions to be used, like work orders or bookkeeping, [C:5:0:0]Administrators[C:7:0:0] must be assigned. 
To do this select the [C:5:0:1]Nobles and administrators[C:7:0:0] menu and click the add button to assign somebody. 
Some [C:5:0:0]Administrators[C:7:0:0] will require [C:3:0:0]Offices[C:7:0:0] to perform their work. 
You can create these with [C:5:0:1]Zones[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Office[C:7:0:0]. 
When trading you select which goods you want from the list on the left, and which goods of yours to 
trade from the list on the right.  Then hit [C:5:0:1]"Trade"[C:7:0:0].  The trader will accept if the deal is fair and 
they can carry away the weight of the things you are selling.
Note that if you have a [C:5:0:0]Broker[C:7:0:0] the value of each good with be shown if their skill is high enough.
When the caravan arrives at the [C:6:0:0]Trade Depot[C:7:0:0], you must click on the depot and select [C:5:0:1]"Bring Goods to Depot"[C:7:0:0]. 
Here you can select which goods you wish to trade.  After everyone has brought their goods you can 
select [C:5:0:1]"Trade"[C:7:0:0].  Don't worry if you have no [C:5:0:0]Broker[C:7:0:0], just select [C:5:0:1]"Anyone can Trade"[C:7:0:0].  You cannot trade 
until your [C:5:0:0]Broker[C:7:0:0] or another resident arrives at the depot.
[C:6:0:1]Barrels[C:7:0:0], and [C:6:0:1]Bags[C:7:0:0].  [C:6:0:1]Barrels[C:7:0:0] are used to store [C:6:0:1]Food[C:7:0:0].  [C:6:0:1]Bags[C:7:0:0] are used to store [C:6:0:1]Seeds[C:7:0:0] 
(and some other things like [C:6:0:1]Sand[C:7:0:0]).  [C:6:0:1]Bins[C:7:0:0] hold just about everything else except [C:6:0:1]Furniture[C:7:0:0], [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:1]Boulders[C:7:0:0]. 
The [C:6:0:0]Carpenter's Workshop[C:7:0:0] is the best place to make lightweight [C:6:0:1]Bins[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:1]Barrels[C:7:0:0], but they can also be made at 
the [C:6:0:0]Stoneworker's Shop[C:7:0:0] and the [C:6:0:0]Metalsmith's Forge[C:7:0:0].  [C:6:0:1]Bags[C:7:0:0] are created at the [C:6:0:0]Clothier's Shop[C:7:0:0] or the [C:6:0:0]Leatherworks[C:7:0:0].
It is a dangerous world, and if the entrances of your fortress are left open, 
you can succumb to invasions. 
The best way to avoid this fate is to build traps and 
lock the ways into your fortress.  The ways to build traps are as wild as your imagination. 
To get [C:6:0:1]Fuel[C:7:0:0] you need to make [C:6:0:1]Charcoal[C:7:0:0] with a [C:6:0:0]Wood Furnace[C:7:0:0], 
found at [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Furnaces[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Wood Furnace[C:7:0:0]. 
You may switch to other forms of [C:6:0:1]Fuel[C:7:0:0] later, such as [C:6:0:1]Coal[C:7:0:0], but you will usually 
need [C:6:0:1]Charcoal[C:7:0:0] from the [C:6:0:0]Wood Furnace[C:7:0:0] to start the process.
In order to make [C:6:0:1]Metal Bars[C:7:0:0] for the [C:2:0:0]Metalsmith[C:7:0:0], you must smelt [C:6:0:1]Ore[C:7:0:0]. 
This can done at the [C:6:0:0]Smelter[C:7:0:0] which can be found under [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Furnaces[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Smelter[C:7:0:0]. 
[C:6:0:1]Ore[C:7:0:0] is mined underground, below the soil layers.
If you have found magma you can build a [C:6:0:0]Magma Smelter[C:7:0:0] directly over it, otherwise you need [C:6:0:1]Fuel[C:7:0:0]. 
The [C:3:0:0]Zone[C:7:0:0] you select must contain a [C:6:0:0]Chair[C:7:0:0], or you can paint a [C:3:0:0]Zone[C:7:0:0] and place a [C:6:0:0]Chair[C:7:0:0] later. 
Remember to assign the [C:5:0:0]Administrator[C:7:0:0] to the [C:3:0:0]Office[C:7:0:0].
Other nobles may appear or be assigned as 
the game progresses.  Use the [C:5:0:1]Nobles and administrators[C:7:0:0] menu to check their wants and needs.
You can then build [C:6:0:0]Walls[C:7:0:0] around the stairs until the leaking water is blocked off. 
Repeat this pattern until you get below the aquifer.
Eventually the [C:6:0:1]Clothing[C:7:0:0] that your residents start with will rot away. 
While it is possible to trade for [C:6:0:1]Clothing[C:7:0:0], [C:6:0:1]Cloth[C:7:0:0], or [C:6:0:1]Leather[C:7:0:0], you can also farm [C:6:0:1]Pigtails[C:7:0:0], 
[C:6:0:0]Wells[C:7:0:0] require a [C:6:0:1]Bucket[C:7:0:0], [C:6:0:1]Blocks[C:7:0:0], a [C:6:0:1]Rope[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:1]Chain[C:7:0:0], and [C:6:0:1]Mechanisms[C:7:0:0].  They can be built over 
any body of water.  It is possible to find water underground, or divert it from the surface.
Aquifers can block the downward progress of your fortress, but it is possible to bypass them. 
One way is to simply re-designate the damp stone for mining in order to build a 3x3 room around the stairs. 
There are also predesigned traps, such as [C:6:0:0]Weapon[C:7:0:0], [C:6:0:0]Cage[C:7:0:0], and [C:6:0:0]Stone-Fall Traps[C:7:0:0]. 
These require a [C:6:0:1]Weapon[C:7:0:0], [C:6:0:1]Cage[C:7:0:0], or [C:6:0:1]Boulder[C:7:0:0] to function. 
Non-alcoholic water is essential to a functioning fortress.  The most favored place to 
get it is from a [C:6:0:0]Well[C:7:0:0]. 
Most require [C:6:0:1]Mechanisms[C:7:0:0] made at the [C:6:0:0]Mechanic's Shop[C:7:0:0], using [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Mechanic[C:7:0:0]. 
To stop some enemies from entering your fortress use [C:5:0:1]Build[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Machines/fluids[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Lever[C:7:0:0] to build a [C:6:0:0]Lever[C:7:0:0]. 
Then click on the [C:6:0:0]Lever[C:7:0:0] and choose to link it to a [C:6:0:0]Bridge[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:0]Door[C:7:0:0].  This will lock the [C:6:0:0]Door[C:7:0:0] 
or raise the [C:6:0:0]Bridge[C:7:0:0], locking you inside. 
The inhabitants also like to drink from [C:6:0:1]Goblets[C:7:0:0], [C:6:0:1]Cups[C:7:0:0], or [C:6:0:1]Mugs[C:7:0:0].  These must be stored in [C:6:0:0]Chests[C:7:0:0] or 
[C:6:0:0]Coffers[C:7:0:0] inside the [C:1:0:1]Tavern[C:7:0:0].  Optionally you can place [C:6:0:0]Tables[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:0]Chairs[C:7:0:0] where your residents can eat. 
You may also leave a cleared space your tavern-goers will use as a dance floor.  If you have any [C:6:0:1]Musical 
Instruments[C:7:0:0] these can also be used by the [C:1:0:1]Tavern[C:7:0:0]. 
There are five types of [C:1:0:1]Locations[C:7:0:0], which we'll go over in turn.
[C:7:0:1]Taverns[C:7:0:0]
[C:1:0:1]Taverns[C:7:0:0] are where your residents gather to drink, socialize, tell stories, and dance. 
To have a fully functioning [C:1:0:1]Tavern[C:7:0:0] you must have a [C:6:0:0]Stockpile[C:7:0:0] with [C:6:0:1]Booze[C:7:0:0] in it, preferably close by. 
[C:6:0:1]Skins[C:7:0:0] can be obtained by butchering [C:2:0:0]Livestock[C:7:0:0] at the [C:6:0:0]Butcher's Shop[C:7:0:0]. 
[C:6:0:1]Skins[C:7:0:0] are tanned at the [C:6:0:0]Tanner's Shop[C:7:0:0], and made into [C:6:0:1]Clothing[C:7:0:0] at the [C:6:0:0]Leather Works[C:7:0:0].
[C:3:0:0]Meeting Areas[C:7:0:0] are [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] where your citizens gather when not working or taking care of their needs. 
[C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] can be assigned to special [C:1:0:1]Locations[C:7:0:0]. Usually one [C:3:0:0]Meeting Area[C:7:0:0] is sufficient, but [C:1:0:1]Locations[C:7:0:0] can span several [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0]. 
gather [C:6:0:1]Silk[C:7:0:0], or tan [C:6:0:1]Skins[C:7:0:0] for [C:6:0:1]Leather[C:7:0:0]. 
After harvesting plants like the [C:6:0:1]Pigtail[C:7:0:0], first process them at the [C:6:0:0]Farmer's Workshop[C:7:0:0], then 
weave [C:6:0:1]Cloth[C:7:0:0] at the [C:6:0:0]Loom[C:7:0:0], then make [C:6:0:1]Clothing[C:7:0:0] at the [C:6:0:0]Clothier[C:7:0:0]. 
Gathered [C:6:0:1]Silk[C:7:0:0] can go directly to the [C:6:0:0]Loom[C:7:0:0].
Your unfortunate citizens are taken to the [C:1:0:1]Hospital[C:7:0:0] when injured.  There they will rest and given water until 
they are seen by a [C:5:0:0]Doctor[C:7:0:0]. 
To fully function your [C:1:0:1]Hospital[C:7:0:0] needs to have [C:6:0:0]Beds[C:7:0:0], 
[C:6:0:1]Buckets[C:7:0:0] (with a source of water), [C:6:0:1]Thread[C:7:0:0] for sutures, and [C:6:0:1]Cloth[C:7:0:0] for bandages. 
that you increase the value of the temple by decorating or adding [C:6:0:0]Furniture[C:7:0:0] like [C:6:0:0]Statues[C:7:0:0]. 
You can also add [C:6:0:0]Chests[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:0]Coffers[C:7:0:0] to hold [C:6:0:1]Musical Instruments[C:7:0:0] that the faithful will use. 
You can also assign [C:5:0:0]Performers[C:7:0:0] to the [C:1:0:1]Temple[C:7:0:0] and even [C:5:0:0]Priests[C:7:0:0] once the [C:1:0:1]Temple[C:7:0:0] becomes more established.
[C:7:0:1]Hospitals[C:7:0:0]
Upon creation of the [C:1:0:1]Location[C:7:0:0] you must choose which deity to dedicate the [C:1:0:1]Temple[C:7:0:0] to, if any. 
Sometimes the adherents to a certain religion will demand that you build a [C:1:0:1]Temple[C:7:0:0] to their specific deity. 
You can see how many worshipers of each deity live in your fortress by scrolling over their names. 
In the [C:6:0:1]Temple Info Menu[C:7:0:0] you can see the value of the [C:1:0:1]Temple[C:7:0:0].  Sometimes the worshipers will demand 
From the [C:5:0:1]Tavern Info Menu[C:7:0:0] you can choose to assign [C:5:0:0]Performers[C:7:0:0] or a [C:5:0:0]Tavern Keeper[C:7:0:0] who will serve the 
visitors drinks. There is also an option to allow outsiders to come to your [C:1:0:1]Tavern[C:7:0:0].
[C:7:0:1]Temples[C:7:0:0]
[C:1:0:1]Temples[C:7:0:0] are places for faithful residents to commune with their chosen deity. 
From the [C:5:0:1]Library Info Menu[C:7:0:0] you can assign [C:5:0:0]Scholars[C:7:0:0] who discuss their interests with the inhabitants, 
and [C:5:0:0]Scribes[C:7:0:0] to record them. Beware!  Some knowledge is dangerous.
In order to hold [C:6:0:1]Scrolls[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:1]Codices[C:7:0:0] you will need [C:6:0:0]Bookcases[C:7:0:0].  You will also need 
[C:6:0:0]Tables[C:7:0:0] for your [C:5:0:0]Scribes[C:7:0:0] to work on.  [C:6:0:0]Chests[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:0]Coffers[C:7:0:0] are needed to store the 
The [C:5:0:0]Doctor[C:7:0:0] will need a [C:6:0:0]Table[C:7:0:0] to perform surgeries.  Some injuries will require 
[C:6:0:0]Traction Benches[C:7:0:0] which can be built at the [C:6:0:0]Mechanic's Shop[C:7:0:0].
[C:7:0:1]Libraries[C:7:0:0]
The thirst for knowledge some residents have can be satisfied at the [C:1:0:1]Library[C:7:0:0]. 
Chief Medical Dwarf
[C:7:0:0] from the [C:5:0:1]Nobles and administrators[C:7:0:0] menu. 
You will need to assign a [C:5:0:0]Doctor[C:7:0:0] to the [C:1:0:1]Hospital[C:7:0:0] from the [C:5:0:1]Hospital Info Menu[C:7:0:0].

we can both agree you are by far the most persuasive!
I must say that is a truly insightful observation!
I confess your stunning argument overwhelms me!
you are so clever I must concede!
I admire how brilliant you are!
Don't tell me to calm myself.
Thank you for your kind words.
You calm down!
Spare me the compliments.

I am so nearly swayed by your greatness alone that we can simply assign you the victory!
Do I look like I need to calm down?!
You must be joking.

No!

You are right.
Let's move on.
Fine.  Let's drop the argument.

No.

I cannot agree.

No, I mean it.

Some laws are just, while others were made to be broken.
Rules are there to be bent, but they shouldn't be flouted thoughtlessly.
Nothing gives them the right to establish these laws.
No law can do justice to the complexity of life.
How can society function without loyalty?  We must be able to have faith in each other.
One must always be loyal to their cause and the ones they serve.
I consider laws to be more of a suggestion than anything.
You must never forget true loyalty.  Repay it in full.
Never lose yourself in loyalty.  You know what is best for yourself.
Loyalty has value, but you should always keep the broader picture in mind.
Don't serve anyone blindly.  You'll only get into trouble.
The whole idea of loyalty is pointless.  Acting purely out of loyalty implies acting against one's own best interest.
How great it is to be surrounded by family!
You can always rely on your family when everything else falls away.
You should only maintain loyalty so long as something more important is not at stake.
Consider your loyalties carefully, adhere to them while they last, and abandon them when you must.
We cannot choose our families, but we can choose to avoid them.
I hold the relationships I've forged myself over family ties I had no part in creating.
Family is the true bond that keeps society thriving.
I was always irritated by family.
There's nothing like a good friend.
Surround yourself with friends you can trust and you will be unstoppable.
Family is complicated and those ties be both a boon and a curse.  Sometimes both at once!
You can't always rely on your family, but it's good to know somebody is there.
Friends are future enemies.  I don't see the difference.  People do as they must.
Building friendships is a waste.  There is no bond that can withstand distance or a change of circumstance.
When all other bonds wither, friendship will remain.
Be careful of your so-called friends.
Power over others is the only true measure of worth.
You can be powerful or powerless.  The choice is yours, until somebody makes it for you.
Friends are nice, but you should keep your priorities straight.
Strive for power.

One should always respect the law.
Society flourishes when law breakers are punished.
 my neighbor.
I don't know 
Art?  More like wasted opportunity.
Art is complicated.  I know what I like, but some I can do without.
The creative impulse is so valuable.
What's so special about art?
You should think carefully before embarking on a joint enterprise, though there is some value in working together.
I treasure my freedom.
We should all work together.
It's better to work alone when possible, I think.  Cooperation breeds weakness.
One should not complain or betray any feeling.
Do not hide yourself behind an unfeeling mask.
Nobody is free, and it is pointless to act as if you are.
Personal freedom must be tempered by other considerations.
All of that so-called knowledge doesn't mean a thing.
Knowledge can be useful, but it can also be pointless or even dangerous.
There are times when it is best to keep your feelings to yourself, but I wouldn't want to force it.
The quest for knowledge never ends.
Some time spent in reflection is admirable, but you must not forget to live your life.
I think self-control is key.  Master yourself.
It is important to discover yourself.
Why would I waste time thinking about myself?
The mind thinks best when the world is at rest.
Give me the bustle and noise over all that quiet!
Why deny yourself your heart's desire?
People should be able to control themselves, but it's fine to follow impulses that aren't too harmful.
We grow through debate and struggle, even chaos and discord.
Some discord is a healthy part of society, but we must also try to live together.
I like a balance of tranquility and commotion myself.
We should all be as one.  Why all the struggling?
Bah!  I hope you aren't celebrating something.
Merriment is worthless.
Be merry!
It's great when we all get a chance to be merry together.
The struggle for power must be balanced by other considerations.
You should always tell the truth.
There's nothing admirable about bullying others.
It is abhorrent to seek power over other people.
There is no value in telling the truth thoughtlessly.  Consider the circumstances and say what is best.
Is there ever a time when honesty by itself overrides other considerations?  Say what is right, not what is true.
There is nothing so important that it is worth telling a lie.
Everything is so much easier when you just tell the truth.
It is best not to complicate your life with lies, sure, but the truth also has its problems.
Sometimes the blunt truth just does more damage.  Think about how the situation will unfold before you speak.
Don't think about the truth, whatever that is.  Just say what needs to be said.
There are times when it is alright not to tell the whole truth.
Be shrewd, but do not lose yourself in guile.
I do admire a clever turn of phrase.
I do admire a clever trap.
There's no value in all of this scheming I see these days.
They are so full of all those big words.
There is a time for artful speech, and a time for blunt speech as well.
I can appreciate the right turn of phrase.
Who are these mealy-mouthed cowards trying to impress?
Life isn't fair, and sometimes you have to do what you have to do, but working toward a balance isn't a bad thing.
Please maintain your dignity.
Always deal fairly.
Don't be afraid to do anything to get ahead in this world.
Some things should never change.
It's admirable when the traditions are upheld.
What do you care how I speak or how I live?
I can see a place for maintaining decorum, but it's exhausting to live that way.
Some traditions are worth keeping, but we should consider their overall value.
Art is life.
We need to find a better way than those of before.
We need to move beyond traditions.
Time spent in leisure is such a waste.
There's some value in leisure, but one also has to engage with other aspects of life.
It's best to slow down and just relax.
There's work to be done!
There's something to be said for trade as a necessity, but there are better things in life to do with one's time.
There's nothing like a great romance!
Trade is the life-blood of a thriving society.
All of this buying and selling isn't honest work.
It's wonderful to be out exploring the wilds!
I could do without all of those creatures and that tangled greenery.
These people carrying on about romance should be more practical.
You shouldn't get too carried away with romance, but it's fine in moderation.
How I long for the beautiful spectacle of war!
War is sometimes necessary, but peace must be valued as well, when we can have it.
Nature can be enjoyed and used for myriad purposes, but there must always be respect and even fear of its power.
Let there be peace throughout the world.

I get so jealous sometimes.
I don't understand how somebody can become so obsessed by what somebody else has.
Sometimes I just don't like somebody.
How can someone be so consumed by hate?
Masterwork?  Why should I care?
A tool should get the job done, but one shouldn't obsess over the details.
I can take or leave merrymaking myself, but I don't begrudge people their enjoyment.
An artisan, their materials and the tools to shape them!
The world isn't always safe.  I can see the value in martial training, the beauty even, but it shouldn't be exalted.
We should all be so lucky as to truly master a skill.
A skilled warrior is a beautiful sight to behold.
Why this obsession with weapons and battle?  I don't understand some people.
All of that practice is misspent effort.
I think people should hone their skills, but it's possible to take it too far and lose sight of the breadth of life.
The amount of practice that goes into mastering a skill is so impressive.
Everyone should broaden their horizons.  Any work beyond learning the basics is just a waste.
Hard work is the true sign of character.
The best way to get what you want out of life is to work for it.
There's more to life than becoming great at just one thing, but being good at several isn't bad!
In life, you should work hard.  Then work harder.
Hard work is bested by luck, connections and wealth every time.
An earnest effort at any required tasks.  That's all that's needed.
It's foolish to work hard for anything.
You shouldn't whittle your life away on working.
We must be ready to sacrifice when the time comes.
Why harm yourself for anybody else's benefit?
I only work so hard, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.
Hard work is great.  Finding a way to work half as hard is even better.
All of this striving against one another is so foolish.
There is value in a good rivalry, but such danger as well.
Some self-sacrifice is worthy, but do not forget yourself in devotion to the well-being of others.
It's a competitive world, and you'd be a fool to think otherwise.
It's good to keep pushing forward, but sometimes you just have to know when it's time to stop.
Wouldn't it be grand to just take my life off and do nothing for the rest of my days?
Keep going and never quit.
Anybody that sticks to something a moment longer than they have to is an idiot.
We will be successful.
I don't think I'm cut out for this.
Have no fear.
Bravery is not a strength of mine.
My goals are important to me.
I don't feel like I need to chase anything.
I look splendid today.
Some people are so wrapped up in themselves.
I like to dress well.
I wouldn't feel comfortable getting all dressed up.
One should always return a favor.
It's not a gift if you expect something in return.
Don't get on my bad side.
You shouldn't waste your life on revenge.
Did you hear the one about the 
That isn't funny.
There's no room for mercy in this world.
Show some mercy now and again.
I am a very, very important person.
Oh, I'm nothing special.
I'm feeling optimistic about the future.
It won't turn out well.
I'm concentrating on something.
Huh?  What was that?
I wonder what they think.
Who cares what they think?
I'm curious.  Tell me everything!
I don't really want to know.
If you have a task, do it properly.
It's not perfect, but it's good enough.  Why fret about it?
I don't feel like telling you about it.
I could tell you all about it!
It really gets me down sometimes.
How can people be so glum?
Be happy!
Is there something to be happy about?
W... worried?  Do I look worried?
There's nothing to be upset about.
I have trouble controlling my temper.
People can be so angry, and I just don't understand it.
I don't handle pressure well.
I'm at my best under pressure.
I'm feeling randy today!
I just don't understand these flames of passion people go on about.
I could really use a drink.
So I overindulge sometimes.
Yes, I want more.  Is that so bad?
Why are they so fixated on these baubles?
There's nothing like a good brawl.
Why must they be so violent?
Sometimes I think I need a drink, but I can control myself.
I am not governed by urges.
I don't always do things in the most efficient way.
We must be careful not to waste.
Get me going and I won't stop for anything.
Maybe I give up too early sometimes.
You're so perceptive!
You don't care, so don't ask.
I don't mind stirring things up.
It's so great when everybody just gets along.
I was never one to follow advice.
I'm not much of a decision maker.
I try to live and behave properly.
What's this about proper living?
I just don't care anymore...
I feel so tired of everything.
Everything is all piling up at once!
I'm feel like I'm about to snap.
I'm feeling really worn down.
It's all starting to get me down.
I can't take much more of this!
I feel angry all the time.
I've been under some pressure.

I've been feeling anxious.
I get fed up sometimes.

Oh joyous occasion!
The love overwhelms me!
Everybody has their own way of life.
I don't understand why they have to be that way.
I'm not going to change my mind.
Try to keep an open mind.
I go with the flow sometimes.
Don't bother trying to play on my emotions.
Friendship is forever.
I don't really get attached to people.
Do your duty.
I don't like being obligated to anybody.
I'm happy to help.
Why should I help?
Everything just so in its proper place!
It's my mess.
Oh, I don't usually think much.
One must always carefully consider the correct course of action.
It's such a joy to be with people.
I prefer to be by myself.
People are basically trustworthy.
My trust is earned, and not by many.
There's so much to be done!
What's the rush?
People should listen to what I have to say.
I try not to interrupt.
Do you have dreams?  Tell me a story!
Try to focus on the practical side of the matter.
I need some more excitement in my life.
I'd just as soon not have anything too exciting happen today.
I guess I just don't appreciate art.
I cannot stand the world any longer...
I encountered a fascinating conundrum recently.
A great piece of art is one that moves me.
It's annoying.
I'm annoyed.
The anguish is overwhelming...
How annoying!
I'm so anxious!
I could not care less.
That's annoying.
So annoying!
I really need to get away from this.
I'm awe-struck!
I am very aroused!
Astonishing!
I care so much!
I'm so incredibly confused...
I'm terribly bitter about this...
This is so boring!
I feel so dejected...
How very delightful!
I can't describe the contempt I feel...
I am so content about this.
How disgusting!
How naive I was...  this strikes me to the core.
I despair at this!
My disappointment is palpable!
I am very, very displeased.
What shall I do?  This is a disaster!
I feel such an intense dislike...
Everything is coming apart!
How embarrassing!
I feel such empathy!
I can't wait to get to it!
Such elation I feel!
What is the meaning of it all?!
I can't believe how great I feel!
Ahhhhhhh!  No!
Eek!
What's that?!
The horror consumes me!
That's incredibly suspicious!
What's going on?!
I am so enraged!
Yes!  It is done.
I cannot be overwhelmed by grief!
Fantastic!
That was very satisfying!
I am so happy!
I must not succumb to fear!
I feel such unbearable sadness...
I will take revenge!
I must press on!
I feel such love!
How blissful!
Such adoration I feel!
How affectionate I am!
I am in complete accord with this!
How admirable!
The agony is too much!
I feel so alienated...
How agitating!
This is so aggravating!
Ha ha!  So amusing!
I am so angry!
Wow!  That's amazing!
I am so torn over this...
Such nostalgia!
My optimism is unshakeable!
The mortification overwhelms me!
I am so nervous!
My patience is as the still waters.
I burn with such passion!
This is such an outrage!
I'm panicking!  I'm panicking!
Such total rapture!
Such rejection!  I cannot stand it.
How pleasurable!
I am so proud!
I feel such remorse!
I repent!  I repent!
Such a relief!
I have so many regrets...
I have been so wronged!
Why does it keep happening to me?  Why me?!
I am overcome by such resentment...
I feel so restless!
I am so ashamed!
I feel such sympathy!
I live to serve...  my dear master...
I can't take it!
I feel so uneasy!
Such unhappiness!
The tenderness I feel!
It's so thrilling!
I am filled with such wrath!
Nothing shall stand in my way!
The wonder!
I'm so worried!
So exasperating!
How exhilarating!
I feel so empty inside...
How enjoyable!
Such freedom I feel!
Such a fright!
You will know my ferocity!
I'm feeling so fond!
The gloom blankets me...
How glum I am...
How frustrating!
Glee!
Not that it's your business!  Harumph!
The guilt is almost unbearable!
I am so grateful!
It makes me so grouchy!
I am filled with such hope!
There is no hope!
Such happiness!
I am consumed by hatred.
How incredibly interesting!
How irritating!
The humiliation!
Such an offense!
How jovial I feel!
Such jubilation I feel!
I feel so isolated!
Such a jolly time!
I'm overcome by lust!
Such misery!
I crawl with such unbearable loathing!
I'm so terribly lonely!
I have strong feelings of ambivalence.
That's very amusing.
I feel alienated.
That's amazing!
That's very annoying.
It makes me very anxious.
I'm very angry.
I feel so anguished...
It's quite astonishing.
I'm very averse to this.
It would be hard to care less.
I'm aroused!
It's really boring.
I really care.
Awe-inspiring...
It makes me very bitter.
I'm very content.
I'm feeling very dejected.
I'm so confused.
Contemptible!
I am very disappointed.
So disgusting...
This is delightful!
I feel such despair...
It has all gone wrong!
This is quite displeasing.
I've become so disillusioned.  What now?
I really don't like this.
I'm so elated.
This is so embarrassing...
I'm so distressed about this!
I'm very eager to get started.
I know it will come to pass!
I am wracked by doubts!
What am I even doing here?
I feel so defeated...
I feel so good!
Such gaiety!
Let's go!
This cannot possibly end well...
That's alarming!
Most shocking!
This is so exciting!
That's suspicious!
This is great!
I am about to lose it!
This is truly horrifying.
I am almost overcome by grief.
I cannot give in to sadness.
I am very satisfied.
It is done.
Begone fear!
How blissful I am.
I will have my revenge.
This is a joyous time.
This is love.
I admire this.
I adore this.
I am not scared!
I accept this.
I'm very aggravated.
The agony I feel...
I'm feeling affectionate.
This is driving me to agitation.
I'm very nervous.
I'm feeling very nostalgic.
I'm so miserable.
I'm so mortified...
I'm really starting to panic.
I'm very patient.
I'm quite optimistic.
This is an outrage!
I am very proud.
I am so spiritually moved!
I feel such passion.
I'm very pleased.
I'm so regretful.
I'm truly remorseful.
I feel so rejected.
I'm so relieved.
I'm really restless.
I feel so wronged.
I must repent.
I'm very resentful.
This leaves me so shaken.
I feel such shame.
This is such a hardship for me!
I live to serve.
This is quite a thrill!
I feel very uneasy.
I'm very sympathetic.
I feel such tenderness.
I'm very worried.
I am wrathful.
I'm very unhappy.
I am filled with wonder.
I really enjoyed that!
I'm quite exasperated.

Are you hunting for treasure?
Thank you for protecting our wisdom.
Thank you for keeping us safe.
Don't let the enemy rest.
I value your loyalty.
It really is a pleasure to speak with you again.
Don't try to throw your weight around.
I have nothing for you.
Have you written a new poem?
Is it time to make music?
Do you have wisdom to share, preacher?
Do you have a story to tell?
You'll get nothing from me with your flattery.
Are you stalking a dangerous beast?
Are you still dancing?
Are in a foul mood?

I know you can handle yourself, but be careful out there.
Don't walk off with anything.
It is amazing how far you've come.  Welcome home.
Only a hero such as yourself can travel at night.  The bogeyman would get me.
I know you've seen your share of adventure, but be careful or the bogeyman may get you.
Hopefully your friends can dissuade you from this foolishness.
Traveling alone in the wilds?!  You know better than that.
The sun will set soon.  Be careful that the bogeyman doesn't get you.
Don't travel alone at night, or the bogeyman will get you.

As you know, we are at war.  You might be able to strike our enemies where our armies cannot reach.
A great beast threatens to bring ruin upon our people.
A night creature has infiltrated our communities and now makes prey of us.
An evil lurks within.
Our people have been tormented by a fearsome foe.
A beast horrible beyond imagining threatens us.
We have been under siege by an ancient force of nature.
It is time to send our cursed enemy back to the underworld.
A terror most foul from the evil depths nigh the underworld plagues us.
A vile monster from the bowels of the earth has been preying on our people.
A creature of the night has our people cowering in fear.
The forces of darkness have descended upon us.
We are besieged by a terrifying monster from the harshest wilderness.
A savage beast from the thick of the wilds hunts us at will.
A beast from underground has been assailing us.
At times, creeping things slither out from below ground.
A beast from the wilds has been harassing our people.
Vanquishing a great beast on our behalf would bring us all much glory.
A ferocious wild animal has been set on us by nature.
A ferocious unnatural beast has become the bane of our people.

The glowing barrier has disappeared!
The glowing barrier has disappeared, replaced by terrible shrieks from the underworld!
We checked that stone for heat!  What devilry is this?!
Deep within this strange place, we've uncovered what must be a treasure of the gods!
Horrifying screams come from the darkness below!
Apocalypse!  We are being judged by the gods!
Some ancient horror was encased here, until now!
We have unleashed the echo of a forgotten divine retribution!
Something evil is emerging from this newly exposed pocket!

human_standard1
[C:VAR:MEETING:ACTOR][VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:ACTOR]:  Greetings from the woodlands.  We have much to discuss.
human_standard_bye
[C:VAR:MEETING:ACTOR][VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:ACTOR]:  Although we do not always see eye to eye (ha!), I bid you farewell.  May you someday embrace nature as you embrace the rocks and mud.
elves_standard1
[C:VAR:MEETING:ACTOR][VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:ACTOR]:  What a pleasant surprise!  Not a single tree here weeps from the abuses meted out with such ease by your people.  Joy!  The dwarves have turned a page, not that we would make paper.  A travesty!  Perhaps it is better said that the dwarves have turned over a new leaf, and the springtime for our two races has only just begun.
elves_standard_bye
[C:VAR:MEETING:ACTOR][VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:ACTOR]:  You have disrespected the trees in this area, but this is what we have come to expect from your stunted kind.  Further abuse cannot be tolerated.  Let this be a warning to you.
elves_firstcontact2
[C:VAR:MEETING:ACTOR][VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:ACTOR]:  I am your liaison from the Mountainhomes.  Let's discuss your situation.

[C:VAR:MEETING:ACTOR][VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:ACTOR]:  Farewell, [VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:NOBLE].  I look forward to our meeting next year.  Our fortunes rise and fall together.

High savagery (66+) blocks civilization placement -- make sure your parameters and presets offer at least small pockets of low-to-mid savagery areas.  
Make sure your parameters and presets offer enough low-to-mid savagery, evil/good appropriate, biome appropriate squares to establish sites.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of civilizations required by the parameters.
If you have very few biome types and are placing good or evil regions, they'll often crowd out the civilizations as well.  
Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many mid-elevation squares as you are requiring low-lying caves.  
The world generator is having trouble placing low-lying caves.  
The world generator is having trouble placing enough civilizations.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of non-mountain caves required by the parameters.
Alternatively, you can remove the requirement of a controllable civilization from the parameters, which will restrict you to adventurers (assuming an appropriate civilization is placed).
Make sure your parameters and presets have adequate squares of this kind.  
Civilizations use available plants in their surroundings as their initial crops.  
The world generator is having trouble placing farming civilizations.  
This problem cannot be resolved by continuing, so you should either abort or skip all rejects for a legends-only game.  
The world generator couldn't find any civilization definitions.  
Dwarves, for example, require non-evil, non-good, unsavage mountain squares that aren't surrounded by the ocean.

it alternates from instant to instant between sluggishness and extreme vibrancy
it appears to be expecting
it leaves water wherever it goes
it always seems to point toward the sun when it is in the sky
it recites verses in a strange language on occasion
it has an incredibly calm demeanor
it rocks back and forth whenever somebody changes their mind in its presence
it heckles those it meets that are not married
it always seems like it is on the verge of crying
it changes direction suddenly at times
it has an unnerving stare
it stares longingly at those nearby
it never abandons its companions
it crackles with energy
it always seems to be looking far into the distance
there is a foul reek about it
it cannot abide anything that lives
it changes color with the phases of the moon
it is very solidly built
it has a distinctly depressing moan
it is difficult to see clearly
it appears to have sharp shimmering edges on many parts of its body
it has an angular appearance
it inspects the ground intently as it moves
flashes of energy pulse across its surface intermittently
it is surrounded by a gentle atmosphere
it radiates an aura of welcoming
it makes those around it want to give up their possessions
it seems to smile constantly
it changes between two colors intermittently
it giggles at random
it seems unerringly honest if one does not concentrate
it returns surrounding light with a new vibrance and intensity
it moves ponderously
it has a very stark look about it
it seems eager to pronounce judgment on others
it appears very deliberate in its actions
it appears to be a very bitter creature
its whole body appears to be faceted in a symmetric fashion
emaciated
it hurls vicious insults constantly
it strides in silence with purpose
starved
twisted
it lopes quickly along the ground
its limbs jut out at asymmetric angles
crooked
joy marks its every movement
joyful nature
it emanates an aura of giving and kindness
kind nature
it bears a look of unbelievable peace
peaceful nature
with singular purpose it seeks to destroy the living
it is crazed for blood and flesh
it shambles sluggishly
it stamps the ground and snorts
shrieking
wailing
baying
bellowing
it howls into high winds
howling
backward
it moves with uneven jerking motions
hulking
its joints are backward
it lumbers along steadily from place to place
lumbering
it has a bloated body
bloated
it is covered with divine writing
it appears spry and vigorous
it is surrounded by an everpresent rush of wind
it acts with unwavering calm
it always seems to be counting something
it changes appearance based on the clouds and precipitation above
it bellows and cheers without pause
it seems to flow as it moves
groaning
moaning
brooding
it groans from time to time
muttering
grumbling
it is a divine being
it mutters to itself as it moves aimlessly
it seems most content when a fair wind is blowing
it never stops moving completely
it is incredibly noisy
it appears to be covered with sharp hooks and barbs
it always seems to have its attention on the most valuable object in the area
its movements sound like the rattling of chains
it mutters to itself about death
it is difficult to look at directly
it looks very proud of itself
it seems to glow brightly from within
it chitters briefly before sunrise and just after nightfall
it always tries to embolden any fighting in its presence with exhortations of bravery, even its foes
it has a tendency to laugh quietly to itself every so often
it tenses up throughout its entire body whenever somebody tells a falsehood in its presence
it is unsettling to be around
it is top-heavy
