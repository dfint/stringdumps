Welcome to Dwarf Fortress
Prepare to guide your stout charges to fortune in a world fraught with many perils. 
You'll begin by creating your world and watching the region's history unfold. 
Once this process is complete, you can prepare a group and send them out to seek wealth deep in the mountains. 
As you dig deeper and more citizens take up residence in your outpost, your doings will attract attention, both wanted and unwanted. 
Deal with challenges as they arise, and you might one day find that your humble settlement has grown to become a Mountainhome, the center of your civilization.
Quick start and short tutorial?
Would you like your fortress located in a forested mineral-rich region of this world where you can play through a short tutorial? 
Non-interactive help will be available whatever you decide.
On your own!
If this is your first time playing, please heed the embark warnings about aquifers, saltwater, and other hazards. 
Some locations are challenging even for experienced players, and it will be a very short game indeed if you don't know how to deal with them!
After you embark, help is available by pressing the help button in the top right corner, including all of the tutorials.
 (1 of 8)
Your view is focused on one elevation at a time.  To move the camera around, press 
[KEY:
] or hold the middle mouse button and drag the view.
To change the camera's elevation, press 
] and 
] or [C:2:0:1]roll the mouse wheel[C:7:0:0].  Hold shift to move faster.
When your view is in the air above other tiles, you can see them below, but you can only interact with objects in your current elevation.
The view will be dark underground until you begin mining.  You can move the camera to the surface with the surface button (highlighted.)  The 
] hotkey will recenter on your wagon.
You can zoom in and out of the play area using 
], [C:2:0:1]Ctrl+mouse wheel[C:7:0:0], or the indicated buttons.
 (2 of 8)
It's time to get to work!  Let's start by digging a stairwell into the ground.  
There may be plenty of hillside to dig into, but you'll want to seek wealth below the surface.
Mining tasks are designated on the play area.  Begin by clicking the highlighted [C:5:0:1]Mining[C:7:0:0] button.
There are several ways to mine.  Stairwells (selected) start at one elevation and are completed at 
the next.  [C:2:0:1]Click[C:7:0:0] the surface, [C:2:0:1]move the camera down one level[C:7:0:0], and [C:2:0:1]click[C:7:0:0] the underground.  Reversing the 
order also works.
Now we'll unpause the game and let the miner finish the task.  Press 
to unpause or use the highlighted controls at the top of the screen.  You should pause regularly starting out.
Let's make a safe place to work.  Select [C:5:0:1]Regular Mining[C:7:0:0] mode, to the left of [C:5:0:1]Stair Mining[C:7:0:0] mode.
Dig a rectangle underground big enough for a large [C:6:0:0]Stockpile[C:7:0:0] and some [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0].  
Consider that most [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0] are 3x3 squares.  Mining through the stone layers further down may take longer, 
but it leaves [C:6:0:1]Boulders[C:7:0:0] which are an essential building material.
Later you can consider making a [C:3:0:0]Meeting Area[C:7:0:0] 
from the [C:5:0:1]Zones[C:7:0:0] menu. Otherwise your citizens will continue to gather by the [C:6:0:0]Wagon[C:7:0:0] outside.
 (3 of 8)
The supplies on the wagon are in danger of being carried off by wild creatures!  
It's time to build a [C:6:0:0]Stockpile[C:7:0:0] underground to unload them.  [C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0] are crucial to moving 
supplies around your fortress where they are needed.
[C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0] are placed with the [C:5:0:1]Stockpile[C:7:0:0] button (highlighted.)  Click it now.
Click the add button, and click two corners of a rectangle somewhere safe 
to place your pile.  [C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0] can be placed both on the surface and underground.  
Once the pile is placed, click [C:5:0:1]Accept[C:7:0:0] and select the [C:5:0:1]All[C:7:0:0] option.
If unpaused, your workers should start unloading the wagon into the [C:6:0:0]Stockpile[C:7:0:0].  
Later you may want to customize your [C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0] by clicking on them and pressing the [C:5:0:1]Custom[C:7:0:0] 
button to forbid certain categories, like [C:5:0:1]Refuse[C:7:0:0] for example.  A separate [C:6:0:0]Refuse Stockpile[C:7:0:0] is a 
good idea to keep your fortress clean.
If the [C:5:0:1]Stockpile[C:7:0:0] menu is still open, you can close it now by right-clicking.  Right-clicking can 
always be used to close most menus, as well as

With shelter ready underground, it's time to build.  
First you need building materials, like [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:1]Boulders[C:7:0:0].  
Before you start chopping down trees you may want to create a dedicated [C:6:0:0]Wood Stockpile[C:7:0:0].  
[C:2:0:0]Haulers[C:7:0:0] will also drop [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] in your [C:6:0:0]All Stockpile[C:7:0:0] unless you turn it off in the [C:5:0:1]Custom Stockpile Menu[C:7:0:0].
When you are ready, open the [C:5:0:1]Woodcutting[C:7:0:0] menu and designate the trunk of a tree on the surface.  
Make sure your woodcutter can walk to the designated location.
Now we just need to wait for the woodcutter to chop down the tree.  
If the fallen logs are accessible, everyone will help store them in the [C:6:0:0]Stockpile[C:7:0:0].  
You can right click to close [C:5:0:1]Woodcutting[C:7:0:0] mode.  Right clicking closes most menus.
If all of your [C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0] are full, go ahead and place another one.
 (5 of 8)
Now that you have the building materials it's time to start building.  
[C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0] are one of many buildings you can place with the highlighted [C:5:0:1]Build[C:7:0:0] button.  Click it now.
Most [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0] require building material, such as [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:1]Boulders[C:7:0:0].  
If you have some [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] stockpiled, you'll be able to place a [C:6:0:0]Carpenter's Workshop[C:7:0:0].  
Click [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Carpenter[C:7:0:0] and place the shop in an empty area on the surface or underground.
When unpaused, a worker should now build the [C:6:0:0]Workshop[C:7:0:0].
Once the worker is done, click on the building to select it.
Your industrious citizens will perform any task added to the [C:6:0:0]Workshop[C:7:0:0].  
Most objects that are placed, like [C:6:0:1]Doors[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:1]Furniture[C:7:0:0], must first be built in a [C:6:0:0]Workshop[C:7:0:0].  
[C:6:0:1]Furniture[C:7:0:0] created at the [C:6:0:0]Carpenter's Workshop[C:7:0:0] usually takes one [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] to build.  Add a task and make a [C:6:0:1]Bed[C:7:0:0].  
Chop down more trees if necessary.  Unpause and wait for the [C:6:0:1]Bed[C:7:0:0] to be completed.
Now that you have a [C:6:0:1]Bed[C:7:0:0] you can place in it the fortress.  
Use the [C:5:0:1]Build[C:7:0:0] menu to place it in a room underground, just like the [C:6:0:0]Workshop[C:7:0:0].  Dig a new room first if you like.  
[C:5:0:1]Beds[C:7:0:0] are found in the [C:5:0:1]Furniture[C:7:0:0] category.  Unlike [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0], [C:6:0:0]Beds[C:7:0:0] must be placed underground.
With a [C:6:0:0]Bed[C:7:0:0] placed, your workers will have somewhere to sleep.  Later you can create a 
room with a [C:6:0:0]Door[C:7:0:0] and use the [C:5:0:1]Zones[C:7:0:0] menu to assign an official [C:3:0:0]Bedroom[C:7:0:0] for each resident.

The rest of the interface is now enabled.
You can click on [C:2:0:0]Creatures[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:1]Items[C:7:0:0] just as you can click on [C:6:0:0]Buildings[C:7:0:0] to get more information about them. 
Click on a [C:2:0:0]Resident[C:7:0:0] to see their needs, inventory, thoughts, relations, and more. 
You can also access information from the [C:5:0:1]Citizens[C:7:0:0] button.

Preparing for the Caravan
 (8 of 8)
You may need supplies before the coming of winter. 
To trade with the autumn caravan, you must build a [C:6:0:0]Trade Depot[C:7:0:0] from the [C:5:0:1]Build[C:7:0:0] menu.
You need something of value to trade. 
[C:6:0:1]Crafts[C:7:0:0] are an easy way to make a lot of trade goods quickly. 
Make the appropriate workshop with [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Crafts[C:7:0:0]. 
An obvious material to use to make the crafts is rock. 
If you dig down enough layers you will find a near infinite amount of [C:6:0:1]Boulders[C:7:0:0] of various 
kinds as well as some [C:6:0:1]Rough Gems[C:7:0:0] if you are lucky.
[C:6:0:1]Gems[C:7:0:0] can be [C:3:0:1]Cut[C:7:0:0] at the [C:6:0:0]Jeweler's Workshop[C:7:0:0].  [C:3:0:1]Encrust[C:7:0:0] them on [C:6:0:1]Crafts[C:7:0:0] and other items to add even more value.
Just the beginning
There's a lot more to learn!
As you enter new menus, there will be information and tips.
The [C:5:0:1]Help[C:7:0:0] button at the top of the screen contains more guides. 
Click it now, and this tutorial will be concluded.
In order to keep your citizens alive in the unforgiving wilderness they will need shelter, drink, and food.
Use the arrow at the top of this window to minimize the tutorial when it obscures your view. 
[C:7:0:1]Shelter[C:7:0:0]
By now you should have a room underground where your residents can hide from the creatures above. 
To make sure they spend their free time down there you will need to use the [C:5:0:1]Zones[C:7:0:0] menu to create a [C:3:0:0]Meeting Area[C:7:0:0]. 
Later you may try the [C:5:0:1]Burrows[C:7:0:0] menu to create a safe place for your civilians to hide when real trouble comes.
[C:7:0:1]Labor[C:7:0:0]
Some essential tasks must be assigned from the [C:5:0:1]Labor[C:7:0:0] menu. 
Click here and make sure you have a [C:2:0:0]
Miner
[C:7:0:0], [C:2:0:0]
Woodcutter
[C:7:0:0], and [C:2:0:0]
Fisherdwarf
[C:7:0:0]. 
If you haven't suffered any casualties, you should have these labors assigned already. 
But if one of these brave workers falls, you'll need to assign somebody to these duties.
[C:7:0:1]Drink[C:7:0:0]
There are two ways to make drinks for your residents.
The main way is by brewing alcohol. 
This is done by building a [C:6:0:0]Still[C:7:0:0] from the [C:5:0:1]Build[C:7:0:0] menu using [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Farming[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Still[C:7:0:0]. 
Once the [C:6:0:0]Still[C:7:0:0] is constructed, click on it and add the task [C:3:0:1]Brew Drink from Plant (or fruit)[C:7:0:0].  If you have no suitable [C:6:0:1]Plants[C:7:0:0], you 
may try [C:5:0:1]Planting[C:7:0:0] or [C:5:0:1]Gathering[C:7:0:0]. 
The task also requires a [C:6:0:1]Barrel[C:7:0:0] from the [C:6:0:0]Carpenter's Workshop[C:7:0:0]. 
If you survive until the caravan comes you may also trade for [C:6:0:1]Drinks[C:7:0:0] 
or [C:6:0:1]Plants[C:7:0:0] there.  The number of [C:6:0:1]Drink[C:7:0:0] rations can be seen at the top of the screen.
Absent alcohol and in warmer weather, you can designate a [C:3:0:0]Water Source[C:7:0:0] from the [C:5:0:1]Zones[C:7:0:0] menu at a river or pond, 
so that your residents have water to drink.  You'll want one of these anyway for other purposes, like cleaning 
and certain [C:6:0:0]Workshop[C:7:0:0] tasks.  You may find water underground.
There's some food on the embark [C:6:0:0]Wagon[C:7:0:0], and you can trade for food, but you can also grow your own. 
The [C:6:0:0]Wagon[C:7:0:0] comes with some [C:6:0:1]Seeds[C:7:0:0], but as you might expect, these crops must be grown underground!
Using [C:5:0:1]Mining[C:7:0:0] orders, you'll need to carve out a rectangular area underground for your [C:6:0:0]Farmplot[C:7:0:0]. 
The underground rectangle must be near the surface, where there is soil (loam, clay, or sand.) One level down should suffice, before you hit rock. 
The highest mountain elevations do not have soil. 
Make sure to leave the ceiling above intact so the underground soil doesn't receive any sunlight.
With a subterranean soil floor exposed, you can place an underground [C:6:0:0]Farmplot[C:7:0:0]. 
This isn't rich soil, but will suffice for now.  Dig deeper to find better soil. 
Select [C:5:0:1]Farmplot[C:7:0:0] from the [C:5:0:1]Build[C:7:0:0] menu.  It's in [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Farming[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Farmplot[C:7:0:0].  Place the [C:6:0:0]Farmplot[C:7:0:0] on the subterranean soil.
You need to select the crops to be grown each season. 
Click on the [C:6:0:0]Farmplot[C:7:0:0] you placed to pull up the [C:5:0:1]Farming[C:7:0:0] menu.
[C:6:0:1]Plump Helmets[C:7:0:0] are edible and the default [C:6:0:0]Wagon[C:7:0:0] comes with [C:6:0:1]Plump Helmet Spawn[C:7:0:0], which are their "seeds".
Note that you can obtain aboveground [C:6:0:1]Seeds[C:7:0:0] from trade or by eating gathered [C:6:0:1]Plants[C:7:0:0], but aboveground farming exposes your [C:2:0:0]Planters[C:7:0:0] to dangers and the elements.
Now your [C:2:0:0]Planters[C:7:0:0], those that can access both the [C:6:0:0]Farmplot[C:7:0:0] and the [C:6:0:1]Spawn[C:7:0:0], will plant the field, and after a period of growth, they'll be harvested. 
If you'd like to focus a few of your citizens on farming, which gives skill benefits, you can assign them to the [C:2:0:0]Planters[C:7:0:0] work detail from the [C:5:0:1]Labor[C:7:0:0] menu. 
[C:6:0:1]Fertilizer[C:7:0:0] and skilled [C:2:0:0]Planters[C:7:0:0] have a direct impact on crop yield. 
These effects are more pronounced deep underground where you can locate the cavern biome and its rich soil.
[C:6:0:1]Potash[C:7:0:0] is the fertilizer of choice, and it can be created in the [C:6:0:0]Ashery[C:7:0:0], using [C:6:0:1]Ash[C:7:0:0] from [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] burned in a [C:6:0:0]Wood Furnace[C:7:0:0].  A [C:3:0:0]Water Source[C:7:0:0] zone and a [C:6:0:1]Bucket[C:7:0:0] are also required. 
[C:6:0:1]Fertilizer[C:7:0:0] is not needed to farm.
[C:7:0:1]Fishing[C:7:0:0]
If there is a river or pond nearby you may consider fishing.  If the water isn't frozen, a worker with the 
fishing labor assigned will begin fishing automatically.
You can optionally choose to designate a [C:3:0:0]Fishing[C:7:0:0] zone if you don't want your workers going far afield.
Remember, your workers do not eat raw fish!  You must build a [C:6:0:0]Fishery[C:7:0:0] to prepare them. 
Do this by selecting [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Farming[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Fishery[C:7:0:0].
[C:7:0:1]Gathering[C:7:0:0]
It is possible to survive by gathering plants outside.  Do this by selecting the [C:5:0:1]Gathering[C:7:0:0] order. 
Then draw a rectangle over the bushes you wish to search.
[C:7:0:1]Butchering[C:7:0:0]
[C:6:0:1]Meat[C:7:0:0] from [C:2:0:0]Livestock[C:7:0:0] you slaughter is a source of food. 
To slaughter an [C:2:0:0]Animal[C:7:0:0] you must first build a [C:6:0:0]Butcher's Shop[C:7:0:0]. 
Do this by selecting the building in [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Farming[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Butcher[C:7:0:0]. 
Once the shop is built, open the [C:5:0:1]Creatures[C:7:0:0] info menu.  From there select the [C:5:0:1]Pets/Livestock[C:7:0:0] tab. 
There you can select which [C:2:0:0]Animals[C:7:0:0] to slaughter.  You may need to minimize the tutorial to see the [C:5:0:1]Slaughter[C:7:0:0] buttons.
Note that some [C:2:0:0]Livestock[C:7:0:0] must eat vegetation to survive. 
To keep them alive use the [C:3:0:0]Pen/Pasture[C:7:0:0] zone from the [C:5:0:1]Zones[C:7:0:0] menu to select a section of grass and click the 
add button to assign the [C:2:0:0]Animals[C:7:0:0].
Zones
[C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] are areas you designate where your citizens will work, socialize, rest, or perform specific duties. 
There are several kinds of [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0], which you can see in the panel on the left.
[C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] are placed much like [C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0]. 
Unlike [C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0], multiple [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] can overlap.
Certain [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] like [C:3:0:0]Bedrooms[C:7:0:0] can be placed several at a time. 
Just make sure you have the correct [C:6:0:0]Furniture[C:7:0:0] placed in the rooms with [C:6:0:0]Doors[C:7:0:0] or vertical entries separating each room before you begin.
Burrows
[C:1:0:0]Burrows[C:7:0:0] are work and living areas where citizens can be assigned. 
Workers will try to limit their tasks to the confines of the [C:1:0:0]Burrow[C:7:0:0], but they will sometimes form paths which pass through other areas.
[C:1:0:0]Burrows[C:7:0:0] can be suspended and unsuspended freely.  When a [C:1:0:0]Burrow[C:7:0:0] is suspended, assigned citizens will ignore it.
It can be useful to assign all of your civilians to a safe emergency [C:1:0:0]Burrow[C:7:0:0] which you activate in case of intruders.
Minecart routes
[C:6:0:1]Minecarts[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:0]Tracks[C:7:0:0] are a convenient way to move a lot of objects around the fortress quickly, though they take a little effort to prepare. 
One [C:6:0:1]Minecart[C:7:0:0] can be assigned to each route, and workers will move the vehicle from [C:6:0:0]Track Stop[C:7:0:0] to [C:6:0:0]Track Stop[C:7:0:0] according to conditions you specify.
Each [C:6:0:0]Track Stop[C:7:0:0] must be linked to a [C:6:0:0]Stockpile[C:7:0:0] for [C:6:0:1]Items[C:7:0:0] to be put on or removed from the [C:6:0:1]Minecart[C:7:0:0].
Only one condition needs to be satisfied for the [C:6:0:1]Minecart[C:7:0:0] to move to the next [C:6:0:0]Track Stop[C:7:0:0].
[C:6:0:1]Minecarts[C:7:0:0] that move too quickly around corners will spill their contents. 
When a route has a steep descent, consider using powered [C:6:0:0]Rollers[C:7:0:0], extra curves, track "stops" between [C:6:0:0]Stops[C:7:0:0] with various friction settings, or a worker to guide the vehicle.
Stocks
Here you can see every [C:6:0:1]Item[C:7:0:0] in the fortress. 
Click on category headings to collapse and expand them. 
If you don't have a [C:5:0:0]Bookkeeper[C:7:0:0], or they don't have an [C:3:0:0]Office[C:7:0:0] to work in, numbers may be approximate.
Work details are one way you can control which workers do which tasks, and they are the only way to assign certain tasks like mining, woodcutting, hunting, and fishing. 
Generally, almost every task will be available for every citizen, but you can both restrict both citizens and tasks. 
Citizens are restricted by using their [C:5:0:1]Specialization[C:7:0:0] button. 
Tasks are restricted by setting their work detail to [C:5:0:1]"Only selected do this"[C:7:0:0].
If a task does not have a default work detail, you can create a custom work detail.  Once you assign citizens to the task, you can then set [C:5:0:1]"Only selected do this"[C:7:0:0] if you want to restrict it.
Nobles and administrators
Here you can view your nobles, as well as assign your administrators, military leaders, and other officials.
[C:5:0:0]Militia Commanders[C:7:0:0] are assigned here. 
Once the first leader is assigned, subsequent [C:5:0:0]Captain[C:7:0:0] positions will appear. 
These can also be assigned from the squad menu.
Certain important functions in your fortress can only be performed by assigned administrators, such as the [C:5:0:0]Manager[C:7:0:0] and [C:5:0:0]Bookkeeper[C:7:0:0]. 
Once they are assigned, you can create work orders, run a [C:1:0:1]Hospital[C:7:0:0], and count and appraise your hoard.
Nobles and certain administrators require rooms, and some may also make demands.
Justice
If you have a law enforcement administrator like a [C:5:0:0]Sheriff[C:7:0:0] or [C:5:0:0]Captain of the Guard[C:7:0:0], witnesses of crimes will make reports, which find their way here. 
Certain crimes are indicative of larger problems, so you should pay attention to them, and affected victims and family members get upset if crime is ignored.
It's up to you to choose whom to convict. 
All available witness information is presented for each case. 
You can also interrogate suspects. 
This is particularly important for schemes where the witnesses might not have the full story.
It is recommended to place a certain number of [C:6:0:0]Cages[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:0]Chains[C:7:0:0] and assign them to a [C:3:0:0]Dungeon[C:7:0:0] zone. 
Officers may opt for physical punishment if they cannot carry out custodial sentences.
Squads
This is the squad menu. 
Here you can create squads, fill their positions, assign equipment and schedules, and give specific orders.
Although this location is relatively safe, it is recommended that you prepare a squad and get them training at some point. 
Wildlife and even your own citizens can still be dangerous at times.
It is recommended that you prepare a squad and get them training as soon as you can. 
You have no idea what's lurking out there.
The World
The world created at the beginning of the game is active, and others may take an interest in your outpost as it grows. 
Stolen [C:6:0:1]Artifacts[C:7:0:0] and kidnapped citizens can be recovered by preparing missions from this screen. 
You can also cause trouble if you'd like to raid your neighbors. 
Raids are created by clicking on any site not belonging to your civilization.
Work orders are used to automate [C:3:0:1]Tasks[C:7:0:0] in [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0]. 
These work orders are set to complete a certain number of [C:3:0:1]Tasks[C:7:0:0] and can be given start conditions.
For instance, you can create an order to [C:3:0:1]Make Wooden Bins[C:7:0:0] if you are out of empty ones, to [C:3:0:1]Brew Drinks[C:7:0:0] if you are running low, or to [C:3:0:1]Make Five Statues[C:7:0:0] every month.
You can limit work orders to a number of [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0]. 
You can also create work orders at specific [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0] from their building sheet. 
The system is reasonably powerful and you can eventually automate almost all of your production if you wish.
If you find that your stockpiles are filling up too fast, you can create room by building [C:6:0:1]Bins[C:7:0:0], 
[C:6:0:1]Barrels[C:7:0:0], and [C:6:0:1]Bags[C:7:0:0].  [C:6:0:1]Barrels[C:7:0:0] are used to store [C:6:0:1]Food[C:7:0:0].  [C:6:0:1]Bags[C:7:0:0] are used to store [C:6:0:1]Seeds[C:7:0:0] 
(and some other things like [C:6:0:1]Sand[C:7:0:0]).  [C:6:0:1]Bins[C:7:0:0] hold just about everything else except [C:6:0:1]Furniture[C:7:0:0], [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:1]Boulders[C:7:0:0]. 
The [C:6:0:0]Carpenter's Workshop[C:7:0:0] is the best place to make lightweight [C:6:0:1]Bins[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:1]Barrels[C:7:0:0], but they can also be made at 
the [C:6:0:0]Stoneworker's Shop[C:7:0:0] and the [C:6:0:0]Metalsmith's Forge[C:7:0:0].  [C:6:0:1]Bags[C:7:0:0] are created at the [C:6:0:0]Clothier's Shop[C:7:0:0] or the [C:6:0:0]Leatherworks[C:7:0:0].
When the caravan arrives at the [C:6:0:0]Trade Depot[C:7:0:0], you must click on the depot and select [C:5:0:1]"Bring Goods to Depot"[C:7:0:0]. 
Here you can select which goods you wish to trade.  After everyone has brought their goods you can 
select [C:5:0:1]"Trade"[C:7:0:0].  Don't worry if you have no [C:5:0:0]Broker[C:7:0:0], just select [C:5:0:1]"Anyone can Trade"[C:7:0:0].  You cannot trade 
until your [C:5:0:0]Broker[C:7:0:0] or another resident arrives at the depot.
When trading you select which goods you want from the list on the left, and which goods of yours to 
trade from the list on the right.  Then hit [C:5:0:1]"Trade"[C:7:0:0].  The trader will accept if the deal is fair and 
they can carry away the weight of the things you are selling.
Note that if you have a [C:5:0:0]Broker[C:7:0:0] the value of each good with be shown if their skill is high enough.
In order for some functions to be used, like work orders or bookkeeping, [C:5:0:0]Administrators[C:7:0:0] must be assigned. 
To do this select the [C:5:0:1]Nobles and administrators[C:7:0:0] menu and click the add button to assign somebody. 
Some [C:5:0:0]Administrators[C:7:0:0] will require [C:3:0:0]Offices[C:7:0:0] to perform their work. 
You can create these with [C:5:0:1]Zones[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Office[C:7:0:0]. 
The [C:3:0:0]Zone[C:7:0:0] you select must contain a [C:6:0:0]Chair[C:7:0:0], or you can paint a [C:3:0:0]Zone[C:7:0:0] and place a [C:6:0:0]Chair[C:7:0:0] later. 
Remember to assign the [C:5:0:0]Administrator[C:7:0:0] to the [C:3:0:0]Office[C:7:0:0].
Other nobles may appear or be assigned as 
the game progresses.  Use the [C:5:0:1]Nobles and administrators[C:7:0:0] menu to check their wants and needs.
In order to make [C:6:0:1]Metal Bars[C:7:0:0] for the [C:2:0:0]Metalsmith[C:7:0:0], you must smelt [C:6:0:1]Ore[C:7:0:0]. 
This can done at the [C:6:0:0]Smelter[C:7:0:0] which can be found under [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Furnaces[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Smelter[C:7:0:0]. 
[C:6:0:1]Ore[C:7:0:0] is mined underground, below the soil layers.
If you have found magma you can build a [C:6:0:0]Magma Smelter[C:7:0:0] directly over it, otherwise you need [C:6:0:1]Fuel[C:7:0:0]. 
To get [C:6:0:1]Fuel[C:7:0:0] you need to make [C:6:0:1]Charcoal[C:7:0:0] with a [C:6:0:0]Wood Furnace[C:7:0:0], 
found at [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Furnaces[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Wood Furnace[C:7:0:0]. 
You may switch to other forms of [C:6:0:1]Fuel[C:7:0:0] later, such as [C:6:0:1]Coal[C:7:0:0], but you will usually 
need [C:6:0:1]Charcoal[C:7:0:0] from the [C:6:0:0]Wood Furnace[C:7:0:0] to start the process.
It is a dangerous world, and if the entrances of your fortress are left open, 
you can succumb to invasions. 
The best way to avoid this fate is to build traps and 
lock the ways into your fortress.  The ways to build traps are as wild as your imagination. 
Most require [C:6:0:1]Mechanisms[C:7:0:0] made at the [C:6:0:0]Mechanic's Shop[C:7:0:0], using [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Mechanic[C:7:0:0]. 
To stop some enemies from entering your fortress use [C:5:0:1]Build[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Machines/fluids[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Lever[C:7:0:0] to build a [C:6:0:0]Lever[C:7:0:0]. 
Then click on the [C:6:0:0]Lever[C:7:0:0] and choose to link it to a [C:6:0:0]Bridge[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:0]Door[C:7:0:0].  This will lock the [C:6:0:0]Door[C:7:0:0] 
or raise the [C:6:0:0]Bridge[C:7:0:0], locking you inside. 
There are also predesigned traps, such as [C:6:0:0]Weapon[C:7:0:0], [C:6:0:0]Cage[C:7:0:0], and [C:6:0:0]Stone-Fall Traps[C:7:0:0]. 
These require a [C:6:0:1]Weapon[C:7:0:0], [C:6:0:1]Cage[C:7:0:0], or [C:6:0:1]Boulder[C:7:0:0] to function. 
Non-alcoholic water is essential to a functioning fortress.  The most favored place to 
get it is from a [C:6:0:0]Well[C:7:0:0]. 
[C:6:0:0]Wells[C:7:0:0] require a [C:6:0:1]Bucket[C:7:0:0], [C:6:0:1]Blocks[C:7:0:0], a [C:6:0:1]Rope[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:1]Chain[C:7:0:0], and [C:6:0:1]Mechanisms[C:7:0:0].  They can be built over 
any body of water.  It is possible to find water underground, or divert it from the surface.
Aquifers can block the downward progress of your fortress, but it is possible to bypass them. 
One way is to simply re-designate the damp stone for mining in order to build a 3x3 room around the stairs. 
You can then build [C:6:0:0]Walls[C:7:0:0] around the stairs until the leaking water is blocked off. 
Repeat this pattern until you get below the aquifer.
Eventually the [C:6:0:1]Clothing[C:7:0:0] that your residents start with will rot away. 
While it is possible to trade for [C:6:0:1]Clothing[C:7:0:0], [C:6:0:1]Cloth[C:7:0:0], or [C:6:0:1]Leather[C:7:0:0], you can also farm [C:6:0:1]Pigtails[C:7:0:0], 
gather [C:6:0:1]Silk[C:7:0:0], or tan [C:6:0:1]Skins[C:7:0:0] for [C:6:0:1]Leather[C:7:0:0]. 
After harvesting plants like the [C:6:0:1]Pigtail[C:7:0:0], first process them at the [C:6:0:0]Farmer's Workshop[C:7:0:0], then 
weave [C:6:0:1]Cloth[C:7:0:0] at the [C:6:0:0]Loom[C:7:0:0], then make [C:6:0:1]Clothing[C:7:0:0] at the [C:6:0:0]Clothier[C:7:0:0]. 
Gathered [C:6:0:1]Silk[C:7:0:0] can go directly to the [C:6:0:0]Loom[C:7:0:0].
[C:6:0:1]Skins[C:7:0:0] can be obtained by butchering [C:2:0:0]Livestock[C:7:0:0] at the [C:6:0:0]Butcher's Shop[C:7:0:0]. 
[C:6:0:1]Skins[C:7:0:0] are tanned at the [C:6:0:0]Tanner's Shop[C:7:0:0], and made into [C:6:0:1]Clothing[C:7:0:0] at the [C:6:0:0]Leather Works[C:7:0:0].
[C:3:0:0]Meeting Areas[C:7:0:0] are [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] where your citizens gather when not working or taking care of their needs. 
[C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] can be assigned to special [C:1:0:1]Locations[C:7:0:0]. Usually one [C:3:0:0]Meeting Area[C:7:0:0] is sufficient, but [C:1:0:1]Locations[C:7:0:0] can span several [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0]. 
There are five types of [C:1:0:1]Locations[C:7:0:0], which we'll go over in turn.
[C:7:0:1]Taverns[C:7:0:0]
[C:1:0:1]Taverns[C:7:0:0] are where your residents gather to drink, socialize, tell stories, and dance. 
To have a fully functioning [C:1:0:1]Tavern[C:7:0:0] you must have a [C:6:0:0]Stockpile[C:7:0:0] with [C:6:0:1]Booze[C:7:0:0] in it, preferably close by. 
The inhabitants also like to drink from [C:6:0:1]Goblets[C:7:0:0], [C:6:0:1]Cups[C:7:0:0], or [C:6:0:1]Mugs[C:7:0:0].  These must be stored in [C:6:0:0]Chests[C:7:0:0] or 
[C:6:0:0]Coffers[C:7:0:0] inside the [C:1:0:1]Tavern[C:7:0:0].  Optionally you can place [C:6:0:0]Tables[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:0]Chairs[C:7:0:0] where your residents can eat. 
You may also leave a cleared space your tavern-goers will use as a dance floor.  If you have any [C:6:0:1]Musical 
Instruments[C:7:0:0] these can also be used by the [C:1:0:1]Tavern[C:7:0:0]. 
From the [C:5:0:1]Tavern Info Menu[C:7:0:0] you can choose to assign [C:5:0:0]Performers[C:7:0:0] or a [C:5:0:0]Tavern Keeper[C:7:0:0] who will serve the 
visitors drinks. There is also an option to allow outsiders to come to your [C:1:0:1]Tavern[C:7:0:0].
[C:7:0:1]Temples[C:7:0:0]
[C:1:0:1]Temples[C:7:0:0] are places for faithful residents to commune with their chosen deity. 
Upon creation of the [C:1:0:1]Location[C:7:0:0] you must choose which deity to dedicate the [C:1:0:1]Temple[C:7:0:0] to, if any. 
Sometimes the adherents to a certain religion will demand that you build a [C:1:0:1]Temple[C:7:0:0] to their specific deity. 
You can see how many worshipers of each deity live in your fortress by scrolling over their names. 
In the [C:6:0:1]Temple Info Menu[C:7:0:0] you can see the value of the [C:1:0:1]Temple[C:7:0:0].  Sometimes the worshipers will demand 
that you increase the value of the temple by decorating or adding [C:6:0:0]Furniture[C:7:0:0] like [C:6:0:0]Statues[C:7:0:0]. 
You can also add [C:6:0:0]Chests[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:0]Coffers[C:7:0:0] to hold [C:6:0:1]Musical Instruments[C:7:0:0] that the faithful will use. 
You can also assign [C:5:0:0]Performers[C:7:0:0] to the [C:1:0:1]Temple[C:7:0:0] and even [C:5:0:0]Priests[C:7:0:0] once the [C:1:0:1]Temple[C:7:0:0] becomes more established.
[C:7:0:1]Hospitals[C:7:0:0]
Your unfortunate citizens are taken to the [C:1:0:1]Hospital[C:7:0:0] when injured.  There they will rest and given water until 
they are seen by a [C:5:0:0]Doctor[C:7:0:0]. 
To fully function your [C:1:0:1]Hospital[C:7:0:0] needs to have [C:6:0:0]Beds[C:7:0:0], 
[C:6:0:1]Buckets[C:7:0:0] (with a source of water), [C:6:0:1]Thread[C:7:0:0] for sutures, and [C:6:0:1]Cloth[C:7:0:0] for bandages. 
You must build [C:6:0:0]Chests[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:0]Coffers[C:7:0:0] inside the [C:1:0:1]Hospital[C:7:0:0] to store these items. 
Some injuries require [C:6:0:1]Splints[C:7:0:0], or [C:6:0:1]Gypsum Plaster Powder[C:7:0:0] for [C:6:0:1]Orthopedic Casts[C:7:0:0].  [C:6:0:1]Soap[C:7:0:0] is necessary to prevent infection. 
Some patients will need [C:6:0:1]Crutches[C:7:0:0] after they are treated. 
You will need to appoint a [C:5:0:0]
Chief Medical Dwarf
[C:7:0:0] from the [C:5:0:1]Nobles and administrators[C:7:0:0] menu. 
You will need to assign a [C:5:0:0]Doctor[C:7:0:0] to the [C:1:0:1]Hospital[C:7:0:0] from the [C:5:0:1]Hospital Info Menu[C:7:0:0]. 
Later you can assign [C:5:0:0]Doctors[C:7:0:0] to specific roles such as the [C:5:0:0]Diagnostician[C:7:0:0]. 
The [C:5:0:0]Doctor[C:7:0:0] will need a [C:6:0:0]Table[C:7:0:0] to perform surgeries.  Some injuries will require 
[C:6:0:0]Traction Benches[C:7:0:0] which can be built at the [C:6:0:0]Mechanic's Shop[C:7:0:0].
[C:7:0:1]Libraries[C:7:0:0]
The thirst for knowledge some residents have can be satisfied at the [C:1:0:1]Library[C:7:0:0]. 
From the [C:5:0:1]Library Info Menu[C:7:0:0] you can assign [C:5:0:0]Scholars[C:7:0:0] who discuss their interests with the inhabitants, 
and [C:5:0:0]Scribes[C:7:0:0] to record them. Beware!  Some knowledge is dangerous.
In order to hold [C:6:0:1]Scrolls[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:1]Codices[C:7:0:0] you will need [C:6:0:0]Bookcases[C:7:0:0].  You will also need 
[C:6:0:0]Tables[C:7:0:0] for your [C:5:0:0]Scribes[C:7:0:0] to work on.  [C:6:0:0]Chests[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:0]Coffers[C:7:0:0] are needed to store the 
[C:6:0:1]Writing Material[C:7:0:0] for the [C:5:0:0]Scribes[C:7:0:0] to write on. 
[C:7:0:1]Guildhalls[C:7:0:0]
[C:1:0:1]Guildhalls[C:7:0:0] are where the workers of specific professions gather to socialize and share their knowledge. 
When deciding which guild to dedicate the [C:1:0:1]Guildhall[C:7:0:0] to, you can scroll over the names of the guilds 
and see how many workers of each profession there are and whether a guild has been established. 
As the guild grows in power they may demand a [C:1:0:1]Guildhall[C:7:0:0] of greater value.  This can be increased by 
decorating the hall and building [C:6:0:0]Furniture[C:7:0:0] like [C:6:0:0]Statues[C:7:0:0].
Before you can create a military, you must appoint a [C:5:0:0]Militia Commander[C:7:0:0] 
from the [C:5:0:1]Nobles and administrators[C:7:0:0] menu. 
Then from the [C:5:0:1]Squad[C:7:0:0] menu you can assign your first squad, led by the [C:5:0:0]Commander[C:7:0:0].  First you must 
assign the uniform.  A new uniform can be assigned later. 
The squad can be customized and you 
can select the leader from the buttons at the top of the squad screen. 
The most important buttons 
are the checkmark to select the squad to give orders and the [C:5:0:1]Position[C:7:0:0] button to add more soldiers to the squad. 
You can give individual orders to the soldiers by selecting them with the checkmark from the [C:5:0:1]Position[C:7:0:0] menu 
or the whole squad from the [C:5:0:1]Squad[C:7:0:0] menu. 
The orders can be found at the bottom of the [C:5:0:1]Squad[C:7:0:0] menu when somebody is selected.  You can make a [C:3:0:1]Kill[C:7:0:0] order and confirm it. 
You can make a [C:3:0:1]Station[C:7:0:0] order to have your squad stand in that position.  You can create a [C:3:0:1]Patrol Route[C:7:0:0] 
and assign your squads to it.  The [C:3:0:1]Defend Burrow[C:7:0:0] order gives you a list of [C:1:0:0]Burrows[C:7:0:0] (created by pressing 
the [C:5:0:1]Burrow[C:7:0:0] menu) for your squad to defend.  The [C:3:0:1]Training[C:7:0:0] order allows your soldiers to train, but you must 
first assign a [C:3:0:0]Barracks[C:7:0:0] created from the [C:5:0:1]Zones[C:7:0:0] menu.
The [C:5:0:1]Equipment[C:7:0:0] menu allows you to customize the uniforms of the selected squads. 
You can assign new uniforms to your squads or add a new one to customize it and add it to the uniform list. 
You can also click on details to customize each individual soldier.
The [C:5:0:1]Schedule menu[C:7:0:0] is a powerful tool to give automatic orders to the selected squad. 
Routines are individual orders given to a squad or individual members of a squad.  From here you 
can assign and edit the routines your soldiers will follow. 
You can also give your squads a monthly schedule.  The routines are aligned along the top of 
the grid and the months of the year are shown down the left side.  To assign different orders 
for each month, line up with your chosen routine, go down the column, and press edit on the 
orders lining up with the month.  You can also copy an order from any cell.  Clicking on the 
column itself will assign the routine to the selected squad.
The regular mining command digs a tunnel into the side of a mountain or deep underground. 
This leaves a "ceiling" above and "floor" below the empty space you have mined. 
A ramp is a special square that can be traversed to the level above. There must be space above a ramp 
and an adjacent wall with an open floor above for the ramp to be usable.
Digging a ramp into a wall on the same level will create a connection to the higher level and remove the ceiling. 
Once a ramp is present, you can start using the regular mining command on the higher level.
Digging a channel will mine out a floor or wall at the current level and dig out a ramp at the level 
below.  If there's no solid ground below the square being channeled, channeling will destroy the floor 
and create a hole instead.
To easily see which ramps go up or down, click the [C:5:0:1]Ramp Vision[C:7:0:0] button by the minimap.
As your dwarves live and work in your fortress they will generate [C:6:0:1]Refuse[C:7:0:0]. 
This includes everything from [C:6:0:1]Bones[C:7:0:0] and other [C:6:0:1]Remains[C:7:0:0] to worn-out [C:6:0:1]Clothing[C:7:0:0]. 
You can gather the [C:6:0:1]Refuse[C:7:0:0] in a [C:6:0:0]Refuse Stockpile[C:7:0:0]. 
Some [C:6:0:1]Refuse[C:7:0:0] can be put to use, for instance [C:6:0:1]Shells[C:7:0:0] can be turned into [C:6:0:1]Crafts[C:7:0:0]. 
Most of it will just generate foul smelling [C:0:0:1]Miasma[C:7:0:0].
If your [C:6:0:0]Refuse Stockpile[C:7:0:0] starts to fill up you can create a [C:3:0:0]Dump Zone[C:7:0:0]. 
Use the [C:5:0:1]Zones[C:7:0:0] menu to select [C:3:0:0]Garbage Dump[C:7:0:0] and draw a rectangle over a cliff or hole and 
then designate [C:6:0:1]Items[C:7:0:0] for [C:3:0:1]Dumping[C:7:0:0]. 
This can be done either from the [C:5:0:1]Item's Info Sheet[C:7:0:0] or by dragging a rectangle over everything 
you want to dump using the [C:5:0:1]Dump Designation[C:7:0:0] tool.
There are many treasures and perils deep underground. 
In order to pursue the wealth of the earth, you must dig deeper! 
Valuable gems and precious metals can be found, along with richer soil, 
desperately needed water, fungal lumber, and other tantalizing mysteries.
To attract migrants and build a successful settlement, 
you will need to keep your citizens happy.
There are many ways to maintain your citizens. 
Alcohol, good food, and personal rooms go a long way. 
Meet their needs by providing [C:3:0:0]Meeting Areas[C:7:0:0] and [C:1:0:1]Locations[C:7:0:0] for socializing, worship, and study. 
Monitor their thoughts to identify problems that you can solve.
Unhappy citizens can act out and cause trouble, and fewer people will risk travel to a 
miserable fortress.
The current and optional path to victory is to have your fortress elevated to a barony. 
From there, you can build your wealth, export goods, and attract more migrants until 
you become a county then a duchy.  A happy fortress with many exports and massive wealth 
can attract the existing monarch of the civilization.
This is the first step to completing the game.  Next, you'll need to satisfy your ruler's needs, 
and finally become a Mountainhome by seating them on a legendary throne with seven mythical symbols of office. 
You'll be an accomplished player at this point.
But this is only the beginning.  Ultimately, your true goals are up to your imagination. 
Call visitors from all over the world with the greatest tavern, library, or temple the world has ever known. 
Build an elaborate water-powered contraption or domesticate previously untameable wild beasts. 
Settle in unliveable regions tormented by ancient evils and defend your fortress from zombies with your own army of vampires. 
Your exploits will be recorded for Legends mode and by the master engravers in subsequent fortresses in your world.

An honored visitor!  What would you like?
Greetings.  Let's trade.
I cannot take so much -- and at such cost!
I wish I could take so much, but my animals...
I won't trade at a loss.
How kind!  Thank you so much.
Ah, wonderful.  Thank you for your business.
That seems fair.  You have yourself a deal.
Yes, and trade we will!  Simply tell me what interests you and what you're prepared to offer in exchange.
I'm confused.  Did you want something?
These _are_ fine items, aren't they?  Now, what do offer for them?
Are these gifts?  Do you wish to trade?
You truly despise life, don't you?  I am beside myself with grief.  Perhaps we will show you how they suffered.
Once a beautiful tree, and now?  It is a rude bauble, fit only for your kind.
I see your low race still revels in death.  That poor, gentle creature...
If it were in a cage of some kind...  As it stands, I can't accept something that wriggles and writhes so.
I simply cannot afford this trade.
Perhaps if you throw in some more goods I can make an offer.
I can't possibly accept, but how about this?  A true bargain.

your more ethical works.  We've come to trade.
A hairy drunkard has come hither to once more disrespect the sanctity of life, I see.
What do you want?
These goods are too heavy and cheap for me to consider.
Do not tempt me!  My beasts of burden cannot possibly haul such a load.
I must make a profit.  There is simply not enough value here.
Please understand the journey must be profitable.  Perhaps you'd consider tossing in a little extra?
Your childish games have made me tired.  Perhaps next time I visit you'll take this seriously.
Leave it to the besotted dullard to miss the finer points of discourse.  I'm leaving.  Do reflect.
You'll need more goods to make this arrangement.  
All I see here is not enough.
Even with your combined trade goods, such as they are, I can't 
fathom you ending up with the items you desire.
I will see that our leader gets this offering.
You are too kind.
Take what you wish.  I can't stop you.
You wish to make an offering to our leader?  
This would please us greatly.  What do you offer?
You wish to make an offering?  We love gifts.
[Laughs uproariously]  You had me 
going there.  Obviously, your copious wit is matched only by your industry!
[Chuckles]  How droll.
I am a merchant, yes.  You see, I wish to trade.  Which of my goods do you desire?
Yes, and trade we will!  Simply tell me 
what interests you and what you're prepared to offer in exchange.
Ah, but my goods are not free!  What do you offer in trade?
These _are_ fine items, aren't they?  Now, 
what do offer for them?
For me?  At no price?  I can accept your offer, or perhaps you wish to trade.
My stones, are you giving me those?  Do you 
wish to trade or to make an offering to our leader?
You truly despise life, don't you?  
I am beside myself with grief.  Perhaps we will show you how they suffered.
Once a beautiful tree, and now?  
It is a rude bauble, fit only for your kind.
I see your low race still revels in death.  
That poor, gentle creature...

very happy about the trading

Make requests for next year's caravan.  They'll charge more for these items.
We will gladly do as you ask and strengthen our bonds of friendship.
Sadly, we do not possess this object.  Best of luck in your search.
Give up this childish errand.  We do not part with our treasures lightly.
Your claim is worthless here.  Trade your lives if you must.
I hear the call.  Let us stop this war.
We will drown out the call with the screams of your dying.  Begone.
I can scarcely believe this good news!  I have some recommendations.
Flattering, but we'd rather maintain our distance from the homeland.
We can abide by this.  Let us work toward mutual co-existence.
Our needs exceed your allowances.  Relax.  They're only trees.
We can grant this request.  Let's discuss the specifics, though...
We cannot stop production just because of your quaint sensibilities.
You do not have an official capable of handling these matters.

We elves are partial in particular to the trees in the forests surrounding your lands.
Whatever possessed you to brave these wilds, where our animal friends are even larger than your kind than usual, we do not know.  But know that this land is sacred to us, these trees more than any others.
  Although we are loath to spare a single branch to your senseless slaughter, 
we are willing to ask that you cap your tree-fells at

I will try to return next year as I am able.

Society flourishes when law breakers are punished.
One should always respect the law.
No law can do justice to the complexity of life.
Nothing gives them the right to establish these laws.
I consider laws to be more of a suggestion than anything.
Rules are there to be bent, but they shouldn't be flouted thoughtlessly.
Some laws are just, while others were made to be broken.
One must always be loyal to their cause and the ones they serve.
How can society function without loyalty?  We must be able to have faith in each other.
You must never forget true loyalty.  Repay it in full.
Never lose yourself in loyalty.  You know what is best for yourself.
The whole idea of loyalty is pointless.  Acting purely out of loyalty implies acting against one's own best interest.
Don't serve anyone blindly.  You'll only get into trouble.
Consider your loyalties carefully, adhere to them while they last, and abandon them when you must.
You should only maintain loyalty so long as something more important is not at stake.
Loyalty has value, but you should always keep the broader picture in mind.
Family is the true bond that keeps society thriving.
You can always rely on your family when everything else falls away.
How great it is to be surrounded by family!
I hold the relationships I've forged myself over family ties I had no part in creating.
We cannot choose our families, but we can choose to avoid them.
I was always irritated by family.
You can't always rely on your family, but it's good to know somebody is there.
Family is complicated and those ties be both a boon and a curse.  Sometimes both at once!
When all other bonds wither, friendship will remain.
Surround yourself with friends you can trust and you will be unstoppable.
There's nothing like a good friend.
Building friendships is a waste.  There is no bond that can withstand distance or a change of circumstance.
Friends are future enemies.  I don't see the difference.  People do as they must.
Be careful of your so-called friends.
Friends are nice, but you should keep your priorities straight.
You can be powerful or powerless.  The choice is yours, until somebody makes it for you.
Power over others is the only true measure of worth.
Strive for power.
It is abhorrent to seek power over other people.
There's nothing admirable about bullying others.
The struggle for power must be balanced by other considerations.
Everything is so much easier when you just tell the truth.
There is nothing so important that it is worth telling a lie.
You should always tell the truth.
Don't think about the truth, whatever that is.  Just say what needs to be said.
Is there ever a time when honesty by itself overrides other considerations?  Say what is right, not what is true.
There is no value in telling the truth thoughtlessly.  Consider the circumstances and say what is best.
Sometimes the blunt truth just does more damage.  Think about how the situation will unfold before you speak.
It is best not to complicate your life with lies, sure, but the truth also has its problems.
There are times when it is alright not to tell the whole truth.
I do admire a clever trap.
There's no value in all of this scheming I see these days.
Be shrewd, but do not lose yourself in guile.
I can appreciate the right turn of phrase.
I do admire a clever turn of phrase.
They are so full of all those big words.
Who are these mealy-mouthed cowards trying to impress?
There is a time for artful speech, and a time for blunt speech as well.
Always deal fairly.
Don't be afraid to do anything to get ahead in this world.
Life isn't fair, and sometimes you have to do what you have to do, but working toward a balance isn't a bad thing.
Please maintain your dignity.
What do you care how I speak or how I live?
I can see a place for maintaining decorum, but it's exhausting to live that way.
It's admirable when the traditions are upheld.
Some things should never change.
We need to move beyond traditions.
We need to find a better way than those of before.
Some traditions are worth keeping, but we should consider their overall value.
The creative impulse is so valuable.
Art is life.
Art?  More like wasted opportunity.
What's so special about art?
Art is complicated.  I know what I like, but some I can do without.
We should all work together.
It's better to work alone when possible, I think.  Cooperation breeds weakness.
You should think carefully before embarking on a joint enterprise, though there is some value in working together.
I treasure my freedom.
Nobody is free, and it is pointless to act as if you are.
Personal freedom must be tempered by other considerations.
One should not complain or betray any feeling.
Do not hide yourself behind an unfeeling mask.
There are times when it is best to keep your feelings to yourself, but I wouldn't want to force it.
The quest for knowledge never ends.
All of that so-called knowledge doesn't mean a thing.
Knowledge can be useful, but it can also be pointless or even dangerous.
It is important to discover yourself.
Why would I waste time thinking about myself?
Some time spent in reflection is admirable, but you must not forget to live your life.
I think self-control is key.  Master yourself.
Why deny yourself your heart's desire?
People should be able to control themselves, but it's fine to follow impulses that aren't too harmful.
The mind thinks best when the world is at rest.
Give me the bustle and noise over all that quiet!
I like a balance of tranquility and commotion myself.
We should all be as one.  Why all the struggling?
We grow through debate and struggle, even chaos and discord.
Some discord is a healthy part of society, but we must also try to live together.
It's great when we all get a chance to be merry together.
Be merry!
Merriment is worthless.
Bah!  I hope you aren't celebrating something.
I can take or leave merrymaking myself, but I don't begrudge people their enjoyment.
An artisan, their materials and the tools to shape them!
Masterwork?  Why should I care?
A tool should get the job done, but one shouldn't obsess over the details.
A skilled warrior is a beautiful sight to behold.
Why this obsession with weapons and battle?  I don't understand some people.
The world isn't always safe.  I can see the value in martial training, the beauty even, but it shouldn't be exalted.
The amount of practice that goes into mastering a skill is so impressive.
We should all be so lucky as to truly master a skill.
All of that practice is misspent effort.
Everyone should broaden their horizons.  Any work beyond learning the basics is just a waste.
There's more to life than becoming great at just one thing, but being good at several isn't bad!
I think people should hone their skills, but it's possible to take it too far and lose sight of the breadth of life.
The best way to get what you want out of life is to work for it.
Hard work is the true sign of character.
In life, you should work hard.  Then work harder.
Hard work is bested by luck, connections and wealth every time.
You shouldn't whittle your life away on working.
It's foolish to work hard for anything.
Hard work is great.  Finding a way to work half as hard is even better.
I only work so hard, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.
An earnest effort at any required tasks.  That's all that's needed.
We must be ready to sacrifice when the time comes.
Why harm yourself for anybody else's benefit?
Some self-sacrifice is worthy, but do not forget yourself in devotion to the well-being of others.
It's a competitive world, and you'd be a fool to think otherwise.
All of this striving against one another is so foolish.
There is value in a good rivalry, but such danger as well.
Keep going and never quit.
Anybody that sticks to something a moment longer than they have to is an idiot.
It's good to keep pushing forward, but sometimes you just have to know when it's time to stop.
It's best to slow down and just relax.
Wouldn't it be grand to just take my life off and do nothing for the rest of my days?
Time spent in leisure is such a waste.
There's work to be done!
There's some value in leisure, but one also has to engage with other aspects of life.
Trade is the life-blood of a thriving society.
All of this buying and selling isn't honest work.
There's something to be said for trade as a necessity, but there are better things in life to do with one's time.
There's nothing like a great romance!
These people carrying on about romance should be more practical.
You shouldn't get too carried away with romance, but it's fine in moderation.
It's wonderful to be out exploring the wilds!
I could do without all of those creatures and that tangled greenery.
Nature can be enjoyed and used for myriad purposes, but there must always be respect and even fear of its power.
Let there be peace throughout the world.
How I long for the beautiful spectacle of war!
War is sometimes necessary, but peace must be valued as well, when we can have it.
Uhh...
It's a great day to fall in love all over again.
People do get so carried away sometimes, but not I.
Sometimes I just don't like somebody.
How can someone be so consumed by hate?
I get so jealous sometimes.
I don't understand how somebody can become so obsessed by what somebody else has.
Be happy!
Is there something to be happy about?
It really gets me down sometimes.
How can people be so glum?
I have trouble controlling my temper.
People can be so angry, and I just don't understand it.
W... worried?  Do I look worried?
There's nothing to be upset about.
I'm feeling randy today!
I just don't understand these flames of passion people go on about.
I don't handle pressure well.
I'm at my best under pressure.
Yes, I want more.  Is that so bad?
Why are they so fixated on these baubles?
I could really use a drink.
So I overindulge sometimes.
Sometimes I think I need a drink, but I can control myself.
I am not governed by urges.
There's nothing like a good brawl.
Why must they be so violent?
Get me going and I won't stop for anything.
Maybe I give up too early sometimes.
I don't always do things in the most efficient way.
We must be careful not to waste.
I don't mind stirring things up.
It's so great when everybody just gets along.
You're so perceptive!
You don't care, so don't ask.
I try to live and behave properly.
What's this about proper living?
I was never one to follow advice.
I'm not much of a decision maker.
Have no fear.
Bravery is not a strength of mine.
We will be successful.
I don't think I'm cut out for this.
I look splendid today.
Some people are so wrapped up in themselves.
My goals are important to me.
I don't feel like I need to chase anything.
One should always return a favor.
It's not a gift if you expect something in return.
I like to dress well.
I wouldn't feel comfortable getting all dressed up.
Did you hear the one about the 
That isn't funny.
Don't get on my bad side.
You shouldn't waste your life on revenge.
I am a very, very important person.
Oh, I'm nothing special.
There's no room for mercy in this world.
Show some mercy now and again.
I'm concentrating on something.
Huh?  What was that?
I'm feeling optimistic about the future.
It won't turn out well.
I'm curious.  Tell me everything!
I don't really want to know.
I wonder what they think.
Who cares what they think?
I don't feel like telling you about it.
I could tell you all about it!
If you have a task, do it properly.
It's not perfect, but it's good enough.  Why fret about it?
I'm not going to change my mind.
Try to keep an open mind.
Everybody has their own way of life.
I don't understand why they have to be that way.
Friendship is forever.
I don't really get attached to people.
I go with the flow sometimes.
Don't bother trying to play on my emotions.
I'm happy to help.
Why should I help?
Do your duty.
I don't like being obligated to anybody.
Oh, I don't usually think much.
One must always carefully consider the correct course of action.
Everything just so in its proper place!
It's my mess.
People are basically trustworthy.
My trust is earned, and not by many.
It's such a joy to be with people.
I prefer to be by myself.
People should listen to what I have to say.
I try not to interrupt.
There's so much to be done!
What's the rush?
I need some more excitement in my life.
I'd just as soon not have anything too exciting happen today.
Do you have dreams?  Tell me a story!
Try to focus on the practical side of the matter.
I encountered a fascinating conundrum recently.
A great piece of art is one that moves me.
I guess I just don't appreciate art.
I have
I've
 been 
considering
on 
the theme of 
the idea of

the subject of 
I just don't care anymore...
I'm feel like I'm about to snap.
Everything is all piling up at once!
I cannot stand the world any longer...
I'm feeling really worn down.
I feel angry all the time.
I can't take much more of this!
I feel so tired of everything.
I've been under some pressure.
I get fed up sometimes.
I've been feeling anxious.
It's all starting to get me down.
I'm 
good
I feel 
just fine
well
I've been 
alright
Everything's 
I'm doing 
fine
Somebody help!
Ah...  uh...
The horror...
Rawr!!!
Waaaaa...
The pain!
How incredibly satisfying!
Oh joyous occasion!
The love overwhelms me!
Such sweet bliss!
Every last one of you will pay with your lives!
Ahhhhhhh!  No!
Eek!
What is the meaning of it all?!
I can't believe how great I feel!
That's incredibly suspicious!
What's going on?!
What's that?!
The horror consumes me!
I cannot be overwhelmed by grief!
Fantastic!
I am so enraged!
Yes!  It is done.
I must not succumb to fear!
I feel such unbearable sadness...

My disappointment is palpable!
How disgusting!

What shall I do?  This is a disaster!
I can't wait to get to it!

Glee!
The gloom blankets me...

Such total rapture!
Such rejection!  I cannot stand it.
Such a relief!
I have so many regrets...
I feel such remorse!
I repent!  I repent!
I am overcome by such resentment...
I feel so restless!
I have been so wronged!
Why does it keep happening to me?  Why me?!
I live to serve...  my dear master...
I can't take it!
I am so ashamed!
I feel such sympathy!
The tenderness I feel!
It's so thrilling!
I feel so uneasy!
Such unhappiness!
The wonder!
I'm so worried!
I am filled with such wrath!
Nothing shall stand in my way!
What am I even doing here?
I feel so defeated...
I know it will come to pass!
I am wracked by doubts!
Let's go!
This cannot possibly end well...
I feel so good!
Such gaiety!
This is so exciting!
That's suspicious!
That's alarming!
Most shocking!
This is truly horrifying.
I am almost overcome by grief.
This is great!
I am about to lose it!
It is done.

I could be questioning my life right now.
This isn't a defeat.
I'm not expecting anything.
I have no doubts.
I'm just not enthusiastic.
There's no reason to be pessimistic.
I should be feeling great.
There is no gaiety.
This doesn't excite me.

It's great to have a friend like you!
And what exactly do you want?
Are you ready to learn?
Been in any good scraps today?
Let's not hurt anybody.

Long live the cause!
Thank you for keeping us safe.
Don't let the enemy rest.
Are you hunting for treasure?
Thank you for protecting our wisdom.
Don't try to throw your weight around.
I have nothing for you.
I value your loyalty.
It really is a pleasure to speak with you again.
Do you have wisdom to share, preacher?
Do you have a story to tell?
Have you written a new poem?
Is it time to make music?
Are you still dancing?
Are in a foul mood?
You'll get nothing from me with your flattery.
Are you stalking a dangerous beast?
Don't walk off with anything.
It is amazing how far you've come.  Welcome home.
It's good to see you have companions to travel with on your adventures.
I know you can handle yourself, but be careful out there.
Hopefully your friends can dissuade you from this foolishness.
Traveling alone in the wilds?!  You know better than that.
Only a hero such as yourself can travel at night.  The bogeyman would get me.
I know you've seen your share of adventure, but be careful or the bogeyman may get you.
Night is falling.  You'd better stay indoors, or the bogeyman will get you.
The sun will set soon.  Be careful that the bogeyman doesn't get you.
Don't travel alone at night, or the bogeyman will get you.
Only a fool would travel alone at night!  Take shelter or the bogeyman will get you.

Hey...  that sounds like a great idea!
Surely any place is better than this.  Let's set off immediately!

The performances will be great.
A demonstration of your skill might convince me.
Keep practicing!
Maybe after you've improved.  Prove you have what it takes.  The life of the traveling performer is a hard one.
Can you manage a troupe so large?
It is I that would lead you, but I have no need of your protection.
Ha!  Such enthusiasm from one such as yourself.
With a band so large, what share of the glory would I have?
I'm sorry.  I can't go with you.
I have no interest in your objectives.

 Outpost Revisited:[C:7:0:0]  You have returned. 
How have your sturdy charges fared in your absence? 
Have they gone on adventures or moved on to richer delving at new frontier settlements? 
Perhaps they are all still here, unwilling to leave the magnificent fortress you prepared for them. 
Deep underground, the promise of treasure and the thrill of overcoming danger have lured you back to this place.  Will you strike the earth again?
 Outpost:[C:7:0:0]  You have arrived.  After a journey from the Mountainhomes into the forbidding wilderness beyond, your harsh trek has finally ended.  Your party of seven is to make an outpost for the glory of all of 
There are almost no supplies left, but with stout labor comes sustenance.  Whether by bolt, plow or hook, provide for your

The glowing barrier has disappeared!
Deep within this strange place, we've uncovered what must be a treasure of the gods!
We checked that stone for heat!  What devilry is this?!
Some ancient horror was encased here, until now!
Apocalypse!  We are being judged by the gods!
Something evil is emerging from this newly exposed pocket!
We have unleashed the echo of a forgotten divine retribution!

[C:VAR:MEETING:ACTOR][VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:ACTOR]:  Farewell, [VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:NOBLE].  I look forward to our meeting next year.  Our fortunes rise and fall together.
[C:VAR:MEETING:ACTOR][VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:ACTOR]:  I am your liaison from the Mountainhomes.  Let's discuss your situation.
elves_firstcontact1
[C:VAR:MEETING:ACTOR][VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:ACTOR]:  You have disrespected the trees in this area, but this is what we have come to expect from your stunted kind.  Further abuse cannot be tolerated.  Let this be a warning to you.
elves_firstcontact2
[C:VAR:MEETING:ACTOR][VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:ACTOR]:  What a pleasant surprise!  Not a single tree here weeps from the abuses meted out with such ease by your people.  Joy!  The dwarves have turned a page, not that we would make paper.  A travesty!  Perhaps it is better said that the dwarves have turned over a new leaf, and the springtime for our two races has only just begun.
elves_standard_bye
[C:VAR:MEETING:ACTOR][VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:ACTOR]:  Although we do not always see eye to eye (ha!), I bid you farewell.  May you someday embrace nature as you embrace the rocks and mud.

Scales are conceived of as two chords built using a division of the perfect fourth interval into 
 notes.  
 notes dividing the octave.  
In quartertones, their spacing is roughly 
, where 1 is the tonic, O marks the octave and x marks other notes.  
 notes spaced evenly throughout the octave.  
The tonic note is fixed only at the time of performance.  
The tonic note is a fixed tone passed from teacher to student.  
After a scale is constructed, the root note of chords are named.  
After a scale is constructed, notes are named according to degree.  
A single note in the fundamental scale is named.

The world generator is having trouble placing tundra regions.  
Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, low-to-mid drainage, freezing areas.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of tundra squares and regions required by the parameters.
The world generator is having trouble placing grasslands.  
Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, low-to-mid rainfall, low-to-mid drainage, non-freezing areas.  
The world generator is having trouble placing hills.  
Make sure your parameters and presets can support mid-elevation, low-to-mid rainfall, high drainage, non-freezing areas.  
The world generator is having trouble placing rivers.  
Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many mountain squares as you are requiring river start points.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of rivers required by the parameters.
Make sure your parameters and presets aren't so variable that biomes change frequently.  
Alternatively, you can increase the number of subregions permitted by the parameters, up to the cap.
The world generator is having trouble placing mountain caves.  
Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many border mountain squares as you are requiring mountain caves.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of mountain caves required by the parameters.
The world generator is having trouble placing low-lying caves.  
Make sure your parameters and presets allow as many mid-elevation squares as you are requiring low-lying caves.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of non-mountain caves required by the parameters.
The world generator is having trouble placing enough civilizations.  
Make sure your parameters and presets offer enough low-to-mid savagery, evil/good appropriate, biome appropriate squares to establish sites.  
High savagery (66+) blocks civilization placement -- make sure your parameters and presets offer at least small pockets of low-to-mid savagery areas.  
If you have very few biome types and are placing good or evil regions, they'll often crowd out the civilizations as well.  
Alternatively, you can reduce the number of civilizations required by the parameters.
The world generator couldn't find any civilization definitions.  
This problem cannot be resolved by continuing, so you should either abort or skip all rejects for a legends-only game.  
The world generator is having trouble placing a controllable civilization.  
Dwarves, for example, require non-evil, non-good, unsavage mountain squares that aren't surrounded by the ocean.  
Make sure your parameters and presets have adequate squares of this kind.  
Alternatively, you can remove the requirement of a controllable civilization from the parameters, which will restrict you to adventurers (assuming an appropriate civilization is placed).
The world generator is having trouble placing farming civilizations.  
Civilizations use available plants in their surroundings as their initial crops.  
Make sure your parameters and raw objects have adequate vegetation.
